## Extracts

* "Romanian public [supported the strike](https://www.romaniajournal.ro/society-people/survey-three-quarters-of-romanians-support-the-teachers-strike/), with many blaming the strike on the handling of the government. [International solidarity](https://twitter.com/NEUnion/status/1666454871590019076) was forthcoming from education unions in other countries as well"  ^b6b369
* "The lack of a political expression for the mounting discontent of the working class, which is ever piling up under the domestic and worldwide economic crises, coupled with example of large strike waves in [Britain](/mdx/britain), and above all in [France](/mdx/france), have all served to push workers in [Romania](/mdx/romania) towards increasing militancy on the industrial front" <span class="sl-obs-tag">#militancy</span> <span class="sl-obs-tag">#strikes</span> <span class="sl-obs-tag">#class-struggle</span> <span class="sl-obs-tag">#workers</span>
