* this paper is like a whole long paper v similar to my [Masters thesis](/mdx/works/thesis/masters-thesis) topic but from a Media and Communications Studies perspective, uses much more in the way of examples of individual creative practises than in enabling generalised resistive practise over the web as I'm looking at

***

* personal memory assembled and disassembled - formalised and destroyed in the process - we are looking in contrast to preserve the subjective context
* ars memoraie - the art of memory, mind palace etc
* memory assistant -> forgetting assistant , similar to chatbot shift of thinking assistant, deciding assistant
* recording > capturing
* 'capture your imagination' - holding it in detention, grasping hold but limiting it - how when I get a spark of inspiration I save it for later but it is held there suspended because I can't make progress on my thinking about it until later. Orchestration of attention rather than contemplating and organising as is implied by recording
* my work is from the perspective of someone who avoids automatic capture of information wherever possible. The only auto-captures without explicit consent I appreciate are eg evidence of appointments stored for medical/legal/financial reasons, and auto browser history/recently visite- though I'd rather Even have more control over these kinds. Even media watching i prefer to track myself
* captured image on phone equally for memory as for instant communication - preferring now immediacy over selectivity
* institutional archivists forced to embraced multiplicity to remain relevant within mass new medium
* early snapshots as tactical appropriation of the media, questioning standardisation and platforming subjectivity !
* encouraging snapshots with a subjective 'spiritual center' - that is, an individual's thematic framing of their snapshots !!
* mentions of trans individuation which is a v useful concept here
* subversive quality to image capture only if used 'attentively'
* mass survey == mass surveillance??
* a para-archival mindset - capturing with internal framework and beliefs - like capturing along themes and within your own guidelines ?

* "he nature of technology is always inherently am- bivalent which means that the poisonous and remedial qualities of technologies are never given. (Stiegler, 2010, 2012). The poisonous dimension of a given technical system, which, as he claims, is often recognized first, might become curative “through the process of appropriation by society and the development of new modes of psychic and collective individuation based on this technical system.”(in Lemmens, 2011)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0err17q6jvtsv7q8eyvkcjr)

This term can be defined as the “internal manipulations of a system” (1984, p.25). If, as said before, every cultural epoch can be characterized by the dominance of technical systems that establish particular regimes, limitations, and norms defining the status of the individual and collective (ibid, p.XXIII), it can also be characterized by various practices that use the ever-existing possibility to shift and re-combine the elements of this system for another, alternative purpose:"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0erwqssytpdwp0d6epqwhjr)

If the technical device is always inherently constrained by a certain horizon of limitations (or a preference of a default use) that regulates its use (and thus its user) at the first level, the deliberate insertion of a specific intention, alternative horizon and set of rules might be seen as constituting an auxiliary, parallel layer that does not change the system, but enables users to benefit from it in another way, and on another level."

* "Opposing the stability, fixed order, and permanence characterizing the nineteenth-century positivist archives (Spieker, 2008), the digital archive foregrounds contingency, performativity, recon- figurability, modularity. The same qualities, adopted as research methods, enable a plurality of avenues for rewiring history of media technological inventions for memory and storage, for instance, by relating digital reconfigurability to rhetorical mechanisms of medieval practices of ars memoriae (Ernst, 2013, p.85), tracing topological resemblances between digital storage and seventeenth-century combinatorial art facilitated by inventions like Kirchner’s Arca Musarithmica (an inventory of musical patterns for generating ever-new compositions), or even by comparing digital databases to campfires “used (like command-line middle-ware) by the younger members of the community to access the information stored in the minds of the elders” (Sol, 1998, no pagination)."

Nevertheless, what I intend to retain from Amad’s concept (and carry on while discussing para-archiving) is mostly a plurality of ways for apprehending the notion of archive and archiving, where, besides seeing them as a burden of the past, techno-political apparatuses that closely regulate what and how we say and remember (Foucault, 1972; Derrida, 1998) can, at the same time, be seen as vital, empowering practices initiated and performed single-mindedly through a creative, insub- ordinate, amateur and disparate use of available technologies, technical components and mechanisms of said apparatuses."

While producing this hybrid-media cabinet and its digital substructure, I explore the material, temporal and performative aspects with a particular focus on the notion of hybridity.

This collective initiative builds more precisely on one of my sound- scape recording practices which fragmentarium hosts. In this section I discuss fragmentarium club as a collective mode of para-archiving that, while invoking the spirit of amateur recording clubs is also debated as a potential, experiential mode of constructively re-articulating relation- ships with capturing technologies and approaching the record of every- day life in the context of capture culture."

The para-archiving mode means that recording and archiving functionalities of the device become deliberately brought to the fore at the cost of all the other, more commonly known and habitual functions (tele-communicating, checking email, news, verifying geographical accuracy and interacting on social media). Para-archiving is hence a media practice in which capturing and cataloging the captured happens deliberately besides, parallel or next to other habitual uses as well as other modalities of automated tracking and capture inherently embedded in today’s network technologies."

  in relation to media. The first option is a dominant hegemonic position. It is a situation in which the viewer takes the connoted meaning “full and straight and decodes the message in term of reference code in which it has been encoded” (ibid. 1993, p.101). In such a case, the viewer is “operating inside the dominant code” (ibid., p.101). The second option is a negotiated position. Decoding the message in this modality is based on a mixture of adaptive and oppositional elements which is to say that it acknowledges the dominant meaning, but adopts it to a particular situatedness, or as Hall puts it, “situated logics” (ibid., p.102). The third position is an oppositional stance. In this, one “detotalizes the message in the preferred code in order to retotalize the message within some alternative framework of reference” (ibid., p.103). This means that the receiver of the message is fully aware of the content (which could be for instance a recognition of its manipulative or persuasive underlying, in the context of social media one could think of it being its economic and commercial underlying) and so either rejects it altogether or accepts it but with a deliberate subversion of the meaning that the arriving media text is inscribed with. Hall’s pluralization of the modes of interacting with media content questions the view on media as an entirely hegemonic apparatus that instigates only one kind of subordinate reactions."

Especially Hall’s third position seems to be much in synchrony with de Certeau’s attendance to everyday life as an arena of cultural inventiveness in attending to various social, technical and cultural frameworks that one voluntarily and involuntary traverses on a daily basis. Departing from the act of reading, de Certeau describes seemingly manipulated by the logic of capitalism and consumption activities of everyday life (such as navigating through the city, cooking, etc.) as always particularly motivated sites themselves potential of establishing frameworks that can subsequently yield conditions for silent production that resists subordination to the mainstream (1984)."

In other words, practice oriented approach as proposed allows to install a particular entry point to understanding media technologies, both historically and contemporarily.

The processual dynamics of mnemotechnical practices are comprehensible and controllable by an individual (or community) directly and voluntarily engaged in these practices. Mnemotechniques evolve in line with specific motivations which guide the creation and organization of the resulting mnemonic traces. Thus, mnemotechniques can be described in terms of craft, which, by Tim Ingold’s definition, is a manual practice comprising “observational engagement and perceptual acuity that allow the practitioner to follow what is going on, and in turn to respond to it” (2013, p.4). Mnemotechnique involves a binding connection between one’s memory and its externalized form. It results in “an associated mnemonic milieu,” where the bond between human subjects (their consciousness), the technologies through which they experience and register the world, and the material records of their experiences tend to hold strong over time. In Stiegler’s words, mnemotechniques can be seen as a specific combination of logos and techne, which is to say, thinking and doing (2011). It is an art of actively (and practically) shaping one’s philosophy of life in relation to its always pre-existing technical dimension. This resonates strongly with de Certeau’s aforementioned aesthetics of everyday life as ways of operating which, in Stiegler’s terms, can be translated into a vital configuration of one’s way of technical being, thinking, and doing.
  Mnemotechniques can be seen as ways of operationalizing selected technology (language, text, imagery, sound, etc.) to produce a material trace which remains in an integral relationship with the subject (or community), his/her awareness, and beliefs. A simple example of a mnemotechnique on a personal level could be note-taking by hand, or a drawing that results in an artifact, a material trace marked by a distinctive style (simultaneously a signifier of a close link between the technological and the human). Although the primary intention of mnemotechniques is to record and transmit the memory of a given experience, every activity that results in the externalization of knowledge into a (technical) artifact can potentially become a vector of memory, and hence, a non-intentional type of mnemotechnique.

* "The transformation of memory practices from techniques of poetry, invention, and creativity into mechanized and then industrialized production of knowledge can be identified by moving back to the Renaissance, when techniques known literally as the art of memory (from Latin ars memoriae) were overshadowed by a mechanical means of processing memory, such as the printing press. Historically, the ancient practice of ars memoriae involved training one’s memory, recall, and creative thinking by assigning particular symbols, vivid images (Carruthers, 2008, p.186), imaginary architectural structures, and monuments to one’s thoughts11. The highly inventive and performative practices of ars memoriae were based on actively tending to memory, spatializing it, and constructing its inventory by breaking it down into discrete expressions and projecting them onto either imagined or real parts of the environment. In medieval times, the principles of the ancient ars memoriae were adopted to monastic traditions of meditation and mindfulness. With the revival of interest in Aristotle’s writings, such mnemotechniques re-emerged in the Renaissance as a kind of art of designing idiosyncratic, visual systems, illustrations, or arrangements combining numbers, letters, and astrological symbols, for establishing different relationships to produce new thoughts and meanings."

  But in the domain of photography the amount of horse power running to waste is appalling – and all for lack of a little system and co-ordination. Shall this be allowed to continue? Shall the product of countless cameras be in the future, as in the past (and in large measure today) a mass of comparative lumber, losing its interest even for its owners, and of no public usefulness whatever? This is a question of urgency. Every year of inaction means an increase of this wastage (Gower, et al., 1916, p.6)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y3qhkydd7a1gr9mam0h6v5)

There is, however, something paradoxical in the utilization of mass-produced cameras to such ends. While it can be seen as a nostalgic attempt to freeze and catalog specific aspects of the disappearing reality of the nineteenth century, one can also look at this systematic deployment of portable, mass-produced cameras – themselves products of modernization, industrialization and scientific management – as a critical apprehension of the consequences of these very processes.

In amateur practices, Lux saw the potential for an emergence of a new modern aesthetics, freeing photography from rigid conventions established by professional photographers (who were typically bound to state institutions that scientifically recorded historically significant events, buildings, archaeological sites, and projects, \[ibid., p.81]), but also an indication of how to creatively address “the inescapable dilemma of an age in which the technological for better and worse had become inextricably embroiled with the sociological”(ibid., p.85)."

* "The illustration at the head of this section, originally published in the aforementioned book by Placcius, depicts an anonymous example of a device for the art of excerpting (Fig. 9.1). When the doors are opened, this simple wooden piece displays a complex array of hooks for hanging little paper snippets with handwritten thoughts, observations, and references to other texts, to be organized according to principles devised by its owner. The device had two major functions. First, to facilitate the organization of discrete notes into a constellation configured according to a set of independent, overriding principles. Second, it was an inventory of singular nodes, modular fragments that could be easily assembled into ever-new configurations, potentially yielding new meanings and inspiring the generation of new modules for the collection. In other words, unlike a book – an earlier form of organizing personal notes, such as the Bibliotheca Universalis – excerpting devices as this anonymous cabinet provide both fixity and mobility, two modes of working with memory: one that facilitates storage according to a set of pre-established coordinates, and one that provides the possibility of continuous reconfiguration, re-edition, and augmentation, to trigger new thoughts, impressions, and meanings. In more contemporary terms, the excerpting practice was comprised of two main elements: software, or a set of principles choreographing how one goes about gathering and ordering knowledge, and hardware, or the material storage, the physical medium, such as a book of paper excerpts or a paper card cabinet (Krajewski, 2011, p.20). In this light, this “recombinant poetics” (Seaman, 2007) of the art of excerpting, can be said to predate the logic of the digital database, where digital data sets are at once stored and open to continuous reshuffling, reorganization, and reordering (Manovich, 2001)."

* "Krajewski reminds us that chance and random encounters with books, strolling through the aisles of libraries, were also common modes of browsing and gaining knowledge, before they were organized in accordance with complex classification systems (Krajewski, 2011, p.32). The eighteenth century marks the time when the organization of knowledge migrated from bound pages of books and catalogs to loosely compiled, individual index cards, enabling multiple ways of navigating a collection of books. Simultaneously, however, this moment can be seen as initiating a more rigorous management of knowledge and collective memory, a more disciplined control over their production, rationalization, systematization, and dissemination. It was also around that time that, as Krajewski argues, “the library becomes a bearer of capital, a data bank, lending information as if it were credit” (ibid., p.24)."

* "the move from physically constructing recording devices to composing assemblages of existing technologies and their use in my everyday life."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4smz3ct9e90vxc7rtk2b4tn)

* "inward-orientation, self-centeredness and “presencing,” which means using media technologies to keep others constantly aware of one’s presence and concerns (Couldry, 2012)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4sn0agzy67j7qkfswwaa5d9)

* "question the dominant role of visual means of relating to our everyday surroundings"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4sn12z2czp9280pkwp74p4w)

* "re-thinking personal capturing technologies as devices for creatively restoring a sense of attachment to a space and a given moment, as opposed to enhancing a feeling of alienation,"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4sn2j2caqvp91ww4ndsz57z)

* "a hybrid inventory, combining two distinct modes of experiencing everyday soundscapes. One mode was enabled through the direct experience in situ, and the other hosted online"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4sn6w9fdmz8g2smp77hmvmp)

* "stickers in the places where the sounds were originally experienced and recorded functioned as interfaces, hinting at and raising awareness of the surrounding sounds. They"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4sn6hby47tvgv8c5zmme1zp)

* "Oliveros claims that hearing is a momentary response to an audible signal, while listening extends the act of hearing through time and space. Thus, the dynamics of (deep) listening, unlike hearing, might stretch from a millisecond (or minute) to several years."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4snbsxzkr4ybt06ccawwys2)

* "On a personal level, these sound bites operate as entry points or markers signifying particular days, moments in life, or experiences of public spaces and events I found myself in"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4snd09zh2kwa715gpcx5dkg)

* "while some recordings have strongly impressed themselves onto my memory, others tend to work on an affective level, less signifying a particular experience than pointing to generic qualities of the spaces, events and daily situations in which they were taken"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4sne30r25p407kys4qf6t7z)

* how often are you in uniquely-audible places? conversation and snippets of music are often the most unique parts of the soundscape. familiar or comforting sounds are common and new or unexpected less so (and unpleasant? I don't really want to subject myself to the intensely new audibly a lot of the time?)

* "been a construction of a repository of manifestations of everyday life in the sonic sphere of public spaces"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4snjjfstb441bb00ryv41dm)

* "while some minutes have highly personal meaning (and thus questionable significance on a broader scale), others involve phenomena that might be seen to be characteristic or symptomatic of our times, and thus more easily identifiable by others (for example local cultural events and rituals found in certain neighborhoods, in some cases jeopardized by socioeconomic transformations, industrial sounds colliding with sounds of nature or temporary, elusive soundscapes coming from demonstrations or acts of political unrest I stumbled upon and witnessed)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4snm7rhgkvchb83m4217wsm)

* this is also true to written experience eg 'uniqueness' isn't necessarily relevant so much as acknowledging the shared experience, forming patterns etc, this kind of everyday is more useful when shared ?

* "encountering a situation which, after reflection, intuitive judgment and discernment, appears to hold a broader significance, I often record an extra commentary to help me later differentiate that minute from the others, and make a short contextual annotation"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4snqqk7pbd1kc3wpzn3evnq)

* "Sontag (2001) describes street photographers as “an armed version” of flâneurie (ibid., p.55). In other words, the camera equips the sensuous and aimless wanderer in urban spaces (the essence of flâneurie) with the chance to leave a material trace. Likewise, minuting can be perceived as a street audiography, or sonically armored flâneurie"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4snwk6qyb30zqz3nv3wptr3)

* 'scrolling' as web-flâneurie - scrolling is strolling

* "One aspect partly retained from flâneurie is that the sonic situations I encounter and record are never intentionally sought; I find myself within them, incidentally, with no anticipation and planning."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4snz8es7482eecd1erxv0mr)

* "intertwined with the vignettes of quotidian life"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4snznbm133a3dqtcf7awa75)

* "over time I have also developed other multi-modal techniques for sampling and excerpting from the experience of everyday life."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4spemd8ppxy8b7jpzasqj18)

* "appropriating existing visual representations, or, more precisely, their excess in the public sphere. By the excess of visual representations I mean found objects and trash, such as snippets of freely distributed newspapers, business cards, and fragments of maps I pick up while walking in public spaces on a day-to-day basis, then assemble into collages and digitize by scanning them."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4spft2dpwxjdsqfbv27swxd)

* "in misquoting, which is an iteration of the older practice of scrapbooking, I use snippets of free local newspapers to compose evocative collages, once a week"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4spga2fb89dva8t7ypjzgat)
