* "Science fiction is often described, and even defined, as extrapolative. The
  science fiction writer is supposed to take a trend or phenomenon of the here-andnow, purify and intensify it for dramatic effect, and extend it into the future. "If this goes on, this is what will happen." A prediction is made."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqbmqzaxq2apwamjxrqx6nh)
* ". The outcome seems almost inevitably to be cancer. So does the outcome of extrapolation."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqbnzrwbp7fgfva4h235xph)
* "somewhere between the gradual extinction of human liberty and the total extinction of terrestrial life."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqbpcvpkpa2y2rv88h4fm1b)
* "Almost anything carried to its logical extreme becomes depressing, if not
  carcinogenic."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqbq64k3gq419p1tqdxf9cn)
* "you can read it, and a lot of other
  science fiction, as a thought-experiment. L"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqbqvd7za6gxxk9m2bhh4fr)
* ", the moral complexity proper to the modern novel need not be sacrificed, nor is there any built-in dead end; thought and intuition can move freely within bounds set only by the terms of the experiment, which may be very large indeed."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqbrpfvmhj58sfpeh4hza8s)
* "The purpose of a thought-experiment, as the term was used by Schrodinger
  and other physicists, is not to predict the future—indeed Schrodinger's most famous thought-experiment goes to show that the “future,” on the quantum level, cannot be predicted—but to describe reality, the present world. Science fiction is not predictive; it is descriptive."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqbskwtdfgkpad48r3y8x7m)
* "Predictions are uttered by prophets (free of charge); by clairvoyants (who usually charge a fee, and are therefore more honored in their day than prophets);"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqbvnq3jnezfx2s39kj2qyc)
* "and by futurologists (salaried). Prediction is the business of prophets, clairvoyants, and futurologists. It is not the business of novelists. A novelist's business is lying."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqbvfsvmjhh8hwad6cc0mmr)
* "Open your eyes; listen, listen. That is what the novelists say. But they don't tell you what you will see and hear. All they can tell you is what they have seen and heard, in their time in this world, a third of it spent in
  sleep and dreaming, another third of it spent in telling lies."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqbw90t5kmwg6qpy0f5hjzn)
* "But our society, being troubled and bewildered, seeking guidance,
  sometimes puts an entirely mistaken trust in its artists, using them as prophets and futurologists. I do not say that artists cannot be seers, inspired: that the awen cannot come
  upon them, and the god speak through them. Who would be an artist if they did not believe that that happens? if they did not know it happens, because, they have felt the god within them use their tongue, their hands? Maybe only once, once in their lives. But once is enough."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqby4239j6ga7nwr470n42x)
* "Our philosophers, some of them, would have us agree that a word (sentence, statement) has value only in so far as it has one single meaning, points to one fact which is comprehensible to the rational intellect, logically sound, and—ideally—quantifiable."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqbzagk0vpe536tbxg8f4rg)
* "Yes, indeed the people in it are androgynous, but that doesn't mean that I'm
  predicting that in a millennium or so we will all be androgynous, or announcing that I think we damned well ought to be androgynous. I'm merely observing, in the peculiar, devious, and thought-experimental manner proper to science fiction, that if you look at us at certain odd times of day in certain weathers, we already are. I am not predicting, or prescribing. I am describing. I"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqc3bts68r0tgvt8841yyh5)
* "we may find—if it's a good novel—that we're a bit different from what we were before we read it, that we have been changed a little, as if by having met a new face, crossed a street we never crossed before. But it's very hard to say just what we learned, how we were changed."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqc40ynq11pe8580c29zmzt)
* "The artist deals with what cannot be said in words. The artist whose medium is fiction does this in words . The novelist says in
  words what cannot be said in words. Words can be used thus paradoxically because they have, along with a
  semiotic usage, a symbolic or metaphoric usage. (They also have a sound—a fact the linguistic positivists take no interest in. A sentence or paragraph is like a chord or harmonic sequence in music: its meaning may be more clearly understood by the attentive ear, even though it is read in silence, than by the attentive intellect). All fiction is metaphor. Science fiction is metaphor. What sets it apart from
  older forms of fiction seems to be its use of new metaphors, drawn from certain great dominants of our contemporary life—science, all the sciences, and technology, and the relativistic and the historical outlook, among them. Space travel is one of these metaphors; so is an alternative society, an alternative biology; the future is another. The future, in fiction, is a metaphor. A metaphor for what? If I could have sa"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpqc6skdr2s7x6seh857ad06)
