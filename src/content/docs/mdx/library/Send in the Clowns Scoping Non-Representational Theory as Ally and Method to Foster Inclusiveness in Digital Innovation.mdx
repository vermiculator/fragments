  innovators as a means to catalyse a type of awareness(es) that makes otherwise inutterable questions possible.

[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdmbk2pzs8a64bc49dsrvdz)
* "orient the reader to what they should expect to read and set out a rationale for the decisions you have made, including decisions concerning: - the form and structure of the thesis (its productive constraints)

I want to demonstrate that I and my communities have a place in academia without distorting our voices, or losing our voices."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdmmh13bsdb5n29qm1hzv0t)

[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdmnpnr8jbvg4fmz1aeeqsd)
* "I really reject the idea that this work is oppositional. It is in many ways really not. It is a love letter to the Academy. It is the embodiment of a hope for change that I compassionately yearn for. It is an expression of my fervent passion for the Academy. But acknowledging in this love, that The Academy is not in a state where I want it to be. It is not in the state that I want to see in. The Academy is in a state of toxic self-contradiction and those who are paying the biggest toll for this are the ones I want to empower."

[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdmt51v0h55k2pejx2xfza3)

* "I think its power resides from being able to tell the stories that are flying by just under the subconscious, just under the utterable, and having a hypothesis to do that kind of work almost feels contradictory because the hypothesis funnels and channels your attention. Its aim is to focus your endeavours into something specific. Yet, if my aim is to find the pre-conscious, it feels a bit contradictory for me to have a
  hypothesis per se, which operates very much not only at the conscious, but therein almost epitomises ‘the rational’. If I am required to articulate one, I can, but to me, this is not a priority."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdn0520h15zxt45cng9z5by)

* "Literature reviews need not be docile. Literature reviews are a curatorial act, and curators are the most powerful people on earth."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdn3yca6a8162d8vybq8yyq)
* "Conducting a systematic literature review hinges on establishing firm, albeit somewhat arbitrary boundaries. Within these boundaries, a specific knowledge domain is defined for exploration. Anything beyond these boundaries is excluded from my review, while everything within them receives equal attention."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdn4xer5mey6zwzjmk43n13)
* "there is also a broader lesson here—to recognize the fundamentally arbitrary nature of systematic literature reviews. It’s an arbitrary set of rules that are making an arbitrary set of decisions to arbitrarily draw circles around what is in a discipline and what is not in a discipline."

* "Different people will inherently perceive and understand the work in varied ways, and this is something I embrace and utilise. I reject the notion of reading as a naively democratic or homogenised process."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdnatgkd0sq0v0p46cxhvax)
* "The reader's interpretation is deeply influenced by their own 'baggage' or personal context."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdnb3ks8h9mqkw2ear6bxpd)
* "English, with its idiosyncrasies, leaves you in a position of never quite knowing whether you’re breaking a rule. This is true for non-native speakers and for different kinds of neurodivergent individuals. It’s very difficult to say, "Am I doing this right?""  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdnd3yv0rk0dmhz5be54wx3)

* "the point where you mention a reference that you’ve forgotten. This forgotten reference, in a way, becomes akin to the unknown soldier, a symbol for the forgotten and the unknown. It represents a hidden, universal experience within academia. The act of forgetting a reference is something many academics can relate to. But what’s intriguing is your choice to make this omission explicit"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdnfnj0gt5674mb4p0783nv)
* "For me, it’s a matter of intellectual and authorial honesty"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdngzd0qkq91y9h40f44h0y)

* "I view translation as a form of meaning-making, where reading"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdnj4nqetsjs45v86018v56)
* "Mermaid - in 6 movements xxxix
  something in translation becomes a transcription, an adaptation of ideas. Translation, to me, often feels more like adaptation than a straightforward translation, where ideas are taken and reshaped to fit within a different linguistic framework."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdnj5eschzbd7vqq1jmgwy8)
* "If I were to design the first lecture of a hypothetical undergraduate course in STS, the first lesson would be that "There are no innocent translations." Every translation is violent or at least highly political. For me, it is very counterintuitive to expect that everything should be translated nilly-willy, in the knowledge of every translation being derivative and mutating."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdnkwq4kg02czfg54v82ksr)

[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdnpfqf45804yq3q7yv6m0j)
* "Different codes are pitched at different audiences and communities. These are little windows behind the text, into my thinking at that time; or buttressing intellectual foundations that I wanted to acknowledge, but not centre on at that moment."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdnq8e2eeb6jb12yt4pzcad)

* "Why did you feel it was necessary to incorporate this, despite the disagreement?
  Me: I see it as an honest account of my experience throughout the entire project."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdnt5j0y3a6x57fh02rcwtg)
* "there’s something intriguing and desirable about IEEE. It uses only a number
  within square brackets for citations, omitting the name of the author of the cited attribution. Readers don’t immediately see who made the statement being cited. I think this forces readers to weigh up the arguments on their merits, independent of the institutional weight of who said them. I’d like to think it democratises knowledge and pushes us to appraise utterances on their merit, not their provenance."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxdnwhpqgk57z06h3r6p4y63)

My work is a claim and assertion of a right to be written. “Other creatures do it differently, but verbal intercourse has always been our human way, and our entitlement.” \[145, p.ix]. I entitle myself to this new writing; as a human and not an other-creature. “Unruly” knowledge \[33, 286] is still knowledge,"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxw0fga6rm16de78qf0y0hj6)
