I do see value in the methods of gathering described here - but we are all also small warm creatures who need to be around other small warm creatures even if we fail to capture more nuanced social skills like control, structure and intentionality

***

* specific purpose
* inclusion/exclusion, numbers
* followthrough, generous authority
* serve others first, caring
* making the implicit explicit
* pregaming, gathering as a social contract
