[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k75bxmbj94qdhs4m518v9mv9)
* "it served as a wellspring for memes, web comics, and new forms of art and popular culture. GIFs emerged on Tumblr blogs as a fully realized visual language"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k75byasj016z72h6wa4a0t1f)

* "“Tumblr also had this darker side,” Melanie Kohnen, an assistant professor of rhetoric and media studies at Lewis & Clark University, told me. “This intense emotional engagement that was prevalent in Tumblr culture and the articulation of emotion could play out in ways that were not always healthy.”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k75c4bqgcfdy92qj83685arn)
* "Tumblr was often criticized for its purity culture—conversations could go nuclear as soon as someone was deemed “problematic,” or once their “fav” had been declared “canceled.” Anonymous “Ask” boxes enabled anonymous harassment, and dogpiling was a common experience for anyone who misspoke."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k75c4xc88vkgk8x62g3ydy8w)
* "Tumblr’s “cascading” dynamic became a source of endless punishment, and cancel culture, as it’s understood and fought over today, can be said to have emerged from its milieu."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k75c53p36p49a959h7bqh11f)
* "The platform’s reputation for earnest, righteous debate also made it a lightning rod for trolling. With all their talk of identity and oppression, Tumblr users would be tagged as whiny “special snowflakes,” “[SJWs,](https://web.archive.org/web/20220201201355/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/10/07/why-social-justice-warrior-a-gamergate-insult-is-now-a-dictionary-entry/)” and “Tumblrinas.” A lot of this vitriol came from the memelords of 4chan, Tumblr’s darker cousin in the online underground and, for a while, its direct rival."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k75c5jbqzw2mmrn53nywptjk)
* "Nagle positioned Tumblr users’ “hysterical liberal” attitude as the cause of an “anti-PC” backlash with significant real-world consequences.) “Tumblr” was a shorthand not just for a certain style of internet user, but also for a generation that was learning to signal its priorities through consumer choices, entertainment preferences, and political actions that utilized social media."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k75c7ysrt5h3w71hg706mesq)
* "“The nail in the coffin was the porn ban,” a former Tumblr employee who left the company in 2021 told me."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k75c965470zq6s9gsdbcb0hp)
* "many former users already talk about the site in the past tense. The sentiment “I miss Tumblr” circulates regularly on Twitter, where nostalgists tend to refer to the latest topics of conversation or styles of humor as “2013 Tumblr” or “Tumblr season 2,” as in, *invented a long time ago … on Tumblr*. Some have even gone back to Tumblr to [live in its ruins](https://web.archive.org/web/20220201201355/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/how-tumblr-became-popular-for-being-obsolete). “i love how irrelevant tumblr is,” begins [a Tumblr post](https://web.archive.org/web/20220201201355/https://queereightiesheartthrob.tumblr.com/post/190627082055) that, ironically, went somewhat viral on Tumblr in February 2020"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k75cbftzaphxg2nn3qse81wk)
* "Melanie Kohnen told me. Tumblr could never cash in on its user base, which is why it sold to Automattic for such a low price, she said; for younger users, “there’s a sense of relief of not being tracked and surveilled and monetized at all times.”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k75cc7vn525h42gaspgckjdw)
* "When I found Tumblr, it felt like finding the whole world. This kind of thing is difficult to put into words—like the sensation of learning how to read, or your first existential crisis. When I talked with Molly Soda, she, too, struggled to capture the extent or logic of the site’s influence. We spent almost an hour on the phone together, reminiscing. Eventually, Soda admitted she was stumped. “Yeah, could I trace its exact cultural impact? Like, no,” she said. “I think it’s bled into everything.”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k75cdt29sjwg4trkg5cmaav1)
