  Human History
summary: Twitter has been a crucial platform for recording significant world
  events since its launch in 2006, but its potential collapse poses a risk of
  losing vast amounts of historical data. Experts warn that if the company goes
  bankrupt, important evidence of events like wars and atrocities could
  disappear forever. Many believe that a managed shutdown could help preserve
  this digital history, but the future remains uncertain.
