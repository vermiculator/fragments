full-title: What Is Small Data, and Why Is It Important?
summary: Small Data identifies entities with HTTP links and describes them as
  subject–predicate–object triples. It retrieves and composes small pieces of
  data on demand instead of bulk-moving huge datasets, cutting cost and
  improving performance and privacy. This enables progressive knowledge graphs
  and more flexible, interoperable data applications.
