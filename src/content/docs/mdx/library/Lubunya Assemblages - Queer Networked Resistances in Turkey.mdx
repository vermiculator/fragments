* "As these thoughts or impressions came to me often quite unexpectedly, I also decided that they should appear in the text without integrating them into the main flow of the manuscript. My aim was that the moments also reflect the methodology of this thesis, which is framed by an assemblage"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ypf45j4b4nz6vyqz4p1895)

* "Queer in Translation (2021), Evren Savcı conducts"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ypv5t2jnm32d1d61eqp9f1)

* "Savcı employs translation as a methodology, highlighting the power of vernaculars in understanding how resisting collectives, such as “the commons”, create their own vocabularies."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ypttzp6cqs5rx3f292q3g7)

* "Turkey’s queer resistance reveals an ambiguity of epistemic divisions between East and West;"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ypz7wtmydas9rsd4tssg5s)

* "(2016), Abdulhamit Arvas also argues that Turkey’s “inbetweenness” in terms of the geographic divisions between East and West or epistemic divisions between coloniser and colonised creates a hybrid space where queerness becomes a site of resistance to forced binarisms (p. 99)(see also Cakirlar & Delice, 2012)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yq09n7z33qjtzc2x13aa05)

* "such dichotomies are (neo)colonial impositions on the queer movement and disregard the situated grassroots struggles in cross-border settings. This is one of the main reasons why I insist on using “transnational” over “global”, as globality tends to refer to a Western hegemony on queer knowledges, while transnationality embraces the complexity of queerness."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yq45x81rehakjrj1jas8kt)

* "activists could go beyond in/visibility regimes due to multi-scalar resistance tactics that help them navigate between different scales of action—namely, individual/collective and local/transnational."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yqf9870a4y7txx33z3rfza)

* "I adopt an assemblage epistemology to understand how queer resistance occurs rather than focusing on what the objects/subjects of resistance are."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yrj4x7d1ew1t2ndv8j645b)

* in analysing the boards/channels as assemblages I see what is held in context of other things, I seem them as multi-modal and concerned with past/present/future

* "decided to approach queer bodies not only in the flesh but also as information (Haraway, 1991)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yrqcxke9xtb9hwddtbhh96)

* "I see queer as an assemblage whose “doing” is epistemologically relevant rather than merely its “being”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yrrm96yvcvwjnr0d4a3t4p)

* "queer not as a utopian ideal, or a queer subject without failures, but queer as “doing” and an everyday practice, both through the successes and failures in resistance"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yrxwy4ym7p67y94d2m1sk2)

* "I explore digital spaces not as “safe spaces” where the queer movement can easily navigate and do transformative action, but as a contested space with the strong presence of surveillance and control regimes"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ys2hyc90cqfpaxwxcns6f0)

* "Queering Middle-Eastern Cyberspaces, Kuntsman and Al-Qasimi (2012) brought together queer digital activism scholars from the Middle East in seeking answers to the question, “how can critical cyber-queer scholarship write about non-Western or non-white queerness, without reaffirming whiteness and the Eurocentre as an epistemic center, thus recreating Eurocentric, Orientalist, and colonial mappings of the world into liberal and backward, queer and heteronormative?” (p. 5). In their ethnographies focusing on contexts such as the Iranian diaspora blogosphere (Shakhsari, 2012), Egyptian blogs (WalshHaines, 2012), lesbian and gay activism on the internet in Turkey (Gorkemli, 2012) and more, contributors bring online and offline experiences of Middle Eastern queers with their local and transnational encounters."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ys3qr0as4s0mp614f2a7eb)

* "Arabic Glitch (2023), the digital media scholar Laila Shereen Sakr discusses how today’s advanced surveillance regimes have transformed humans into “data bodies” whose online traceability and embodied personalities are entangled. On a hopeful note, she uses glitch theory to show how social media activists in the Arab world use errors and disruptions in digital technologies to create community-based actions and resist authoritarian surveillance regimes"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ys4b22kkvxnp90xp63vsgx)

* "One of the main tasks of this thesis is to show how queer knowledge production and memories remain alive in authoritarian times."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ys5h18mbs7gaann4xk53kf)

* "(2021), Serena Owusua Dankwa refuses categorical approaches to sexuality and identifies that same-sex intimacies are built through situated experiences of failures and victories, and that stories and practices of intimacies like this build queer knowledge"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ys6e8h1kjyj0mqgd9s0d00)

* "queer knowledge production as an integral part of transformative politics, I focus on queer counter-archives as a way of doing resistance (Article IV)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ys6mz9er0ryq33szjv9hec)

* "José Esteban Muñoz’s (2019) discussions on queer hope, I focus on the non-linear experiences of queerness where queer counter-archives have the potential to make stories of resistance travel across time and space. Empirically in this study, those memories of the past, not necessarily memories of success but also of loss and failure, play an affective role for imaginaries of the queer movement. In conceptualising counter-archives, I am inspired by Ann Cvetkovich, who in An Archive of Feelings (2003) finds archival value in emotional experiences and life stories. From a Turkish context, Yener Bayramoğlu (2021) argues that archives of resistance contribute to queer hope in maintaining queer presence in the public sphere."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ys9rtyqjk0c74042kh4n5s)

* "hile I fully acknowledge the value of queer counterarchives in sustaining resistance cultures, I also argue that the analysis of collective feelings should go beyond the conditions of hope/hopelessness. Hope can be a troubling concept to hold onto, or may even come across as
  34"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ysampsjkd0ck7ksdx090pf)

* "naïve, when (settler) colonial, authoritarian and capitalist projects are dominating the world, and feelings such as rage and anger become necessary to survive."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ysan8pb5cnkz8s8af42n8w)

* "argues for the role of technological affordances in providing flexibility to refracted publics."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ysm6m82yns2z7j05jyjwn9)

* "I discuss the role of emotions and memories in making resistance not only as a spatial struggle but also as a question of time."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ysmpcydt8vbg9f20e368k3)

* "It is a flexible, fluid and ever-changing mode to feel and identify as a collective based on sexual variance and gender identity. It is also not free from internal challenges, as different subjects cohabit different power positions. With that in mind, is it possible to categorise a queer/lubunya subject?"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yspkgdqty0wyejjggw52ey)

* "begin by asking whether it is necessary—or even possible—to conceptualise lubunya as a fixed subject category"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ysr8ba7mdxgw5tqf1qkrma)

* "Lubunya is also a “movement”. It refers to queer subjects with experiences of (im)mobility, who engage with and reshape cultures of resistance through activism, both within and outside organisational structures"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ysv0hhkgjazva0tnq9jx6x)

* "I adopt an assemblage ontological framework (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987) and thus my focus is on how that “movement” is formed by relations between different actors from bodies that are organic and inorganic and in their relations to spaces and affects. The assemblage framework helps me see the “identity as an event of temporality” rather than as a given status of stability (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ysxc3q4ft7wgkheqn4mktp)

* "a “subjectless critique” to renew queer studies by destabilising an understanding of queer subjects as a fixed identity category"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yt0k076kx04gyfgn4zapq2)

* "“what might be called the ‘subjectless’ critique of queer studies disallows any positing of a proper subject or object for the field by insisting that queer has no fixed political referent” (p. 3)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yt2vteejca5v29yw8qxf2d)

* "thinking of a queer time and space beyond modernist linearity, of queer utopianism and futurity, as well as in showing the complexity of queer resistance and its intersections with other power hierarchies based on race, class and ableism"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yt3dmy6je2dem92r6wnywz)

* "David L. Eng and Jasbir Puar (2020) argue furthermore for an “objectless” queer critique, claiming that the subject-object distinction is rather blurry in today’s biopolitical materialisms (p. 16). Rooted in an object-oriented ontology, they focus on the biopolitics of objects whose agential roles may be impactful for queer lives"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yt4yqj9h4vhtvtz4c3d80c)

* "intersectionality and assemblage theory can be in friction rather than in opposition to each other (Puar, 2020, p. 50)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yt7feqn2ftj20p1mz1yygk)

* "Puar argues that the “modern subject is exhausted” (2017, p. 206); it is overly analysed, and fragmented. She states that:
  …to dismiss assemblages in favor of retaining intersectional identitarian frameworks is to dismiss how societies of control tweak and modulate bodies as matter, not predominantly through signification or identity interpellation but rather through affective capacities and tendencies. (2020, p. 63)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yt82hvhq14megsxe8p5dej)

* this is why I favour 'multiply marginalised' as well as neuroqueer

* "grasp the importance of temporality in catching the moments of action and their potential for radical transformation (Nash & Gorman-Murray, 2017)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ytagn61f1nxs63ezs44727)

* "This assemblage approach is an ontological shift from “subjects of rights” to “subjects of acts” whose interaction with other humans and non-humans becomes central for (queer) knowledge production (Haraway, 1991). A similar shift is observed in queer movement transnationally, where stable categories of gender and sexuality are increasingly deconstructed, and queer grassroots groups are aiming for a radical transformation of the heteropatriarchal gender regime (Nash & Gorman-Murray, 2017, p. 1524; Puar, 2017)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ytn78950nq1v1r5fqj3r2j)

* "look at the relational modes that together make lubunya into a movement."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ytpk89nh7s17w9747938jz)

* "Mouffe’s theory of citizenship reveals the radical democratic potential of plurality: that citizenship is never a fixed category of law, and that its radical potential comes from the openness to change its meaning through political activism. This kind of approach resonates with the assemblage thinking of sexual citizenship suggested by Puar (2013, 2017) in which political practice becomes the facet of radical transformation to what citizenship may become."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yts8w55hjs3d3c2a9bd6b0)

* "Puar examined how Western nationstates build themselves as sexually progressive through a sexualised and racialised exclusion of people of colour as “potentially homophobic”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ytvvt7tkwb4xqmyy8y16r1)

* "According to queer and crip theory scholar Margrit Shildrick (2013), a topdown conceptualisation of citizenship leads to a “citizenship of indifference” that normatively defines the fixed rights and duties of any citizen. It functions inherently for the normalisation and domestication of bodies, or, in other words, for a standardisation of binary, heterosexual and ableist bodies in framing the normative citizen. Shildrick uses Michel Foucault’s concept of governmentality to explain the notion of citizen, in which law produces its truth and disciplines the citizen-subject according to intended norms (Foucault, 1978) and in which “equality of all before the law inherently risks effacing difference, at the very moment of appearing to recognise it” (Shildrick, 2013, p. 144)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yty2dv73jtbywz2e59n28g)

* "In previous studies on resistance, it is conceptualised as an exercise of action or a practice: to “resist” means to withstand hegemonic power structures, with an aim of destabilising the recurrent power relations (Baaz et al., 2016, p. 17). Two resistance traditions have been distinguished by resistance scholars: one in the form of visible contentious resistance such as social movements and street protests (della Porta, 2018; Tilly, 2008) and the other in the form of everyday resistance practices that are subtle and integrated into social life, and yet potentially transformative (Vinthagen & Johansson, 2013, p. 3)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ytz398r182gfrv8d5x1p1e)

* "From this perspective, the success of a movement is measured by its visibility in public spaces and in contentious transformative actions such as strikes, street protests and public campaigns (della Porta, 2020; Tilly, 2008). Although these are very useful resistance tactics, in this thesis I challenge the idea of paradigms of visibility as a measure of success and go beyond the visibility/invisibility dichotomies (see Article III) (cf. Liinason, 2020)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4ytzwevwkh2cwnsmgm2qz9s)

* "the potential undesirability of visible contentious politics for reasons of safety of the queer community, especially with the rise of global anti-genderism and local authoritarianisms (Çağatay, Liinason, & Sasunkevich, 2022; Stella, 2015). I am inspired by the idea of resistance in the “grey zone” (Murru, 2020, p. 172) that brings together unorganised and (generally) individual actions and more organised forms of activism of the lubunya movement (Çağatay, Liinason, & Sasunkevich, 2022)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yv0wjr0gf0hq027t669805)

* "This blurring of boundaries challenges the ontological primacy of contentious politics where large-scale resistances are strongly associated with urban space. It opens for individualised, subtle and everyday forms of resistance in translocal actions (Lilja et al., 2017)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yv20amsv0cqhcdqw8hvkg2)

* "Çağatay, Liinason and Sasunkevich (2022) propose a multi-scalar approach to analysing resistance, which acknowledges feminist and queer resistances at micro, meso and macro levels and their constant interchange with each other. Adopting this multi-scalar perspective, my conceptualisation of resistance
  recognises the togetherness of
  individual/collective and subtle/contentious forms of resistance practices"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yv305g3qxrr9xdmbkvk262)

* "The critical point of analysis here is how these practices become translocated and move from one scale to another via networked connectivity and digital affordances."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yv3hx06v2s1fww95kcd5vg)

* "The concept of counterpublics is widely used by queer scholars in describing
  queer communities’ relationship to space. I use neo-Marxist political philosopher Nancy Fraser’s conceptualisation of counterpublic due to its importance for emancipatory and transnational queer movements. According to Fraser, feminist and queer struggles challenge the hegemony of the (neo)liberal political subject who appears as a majoritarian male (Fraser, 1992, 2007)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yv4q57wz4ppecd853cjwtp)

* "Fraser calls these alternative publics that are critical to the neoliberal regime “counterpublics”: their members come together for oppositional interpretations of redistributive justice and politics of recognition to produce collective counter-discourses (Fraser, 1990, p. 67). To conceptualise a global justice of “queer counterpublics” (Soriano, 2014), it is important to critically discuss the injustices targeting queer people based on exclusionary neoliberal politics and identify colonial capitalist power hierarchies targeting the queer communities."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yv5bcp0k8qgcexvca7kcfq)

* "it is important to acknowledge an agential character of “spaces of resistance”, not as passive geographic surfaces for social movements but as affective entities with their contested and reclaimed histories (Escobar, 2001)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yv6b7fyq6952nd4kgzs153)

* "Doreen Massey (2005) and her understanding of space as a relational concept. Massey sees space as dynamic and ever-changing; its meanings are never fixed but remain in constant transformations due to struggles over them. By using an open conceptualisation of space as contested, I argue for its relationality, whether online or offline"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yv7hny29tt288vdv5dkybc)

* "Place is, rather, conceptualised with its symbolism created in a particular time and space. Therefore, the effective place-making is a practice based on queer memories."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yva7fcwdcsgzcnzt60a999)

* "The Covid-19 pandemic significantly reshaped perceptions of public and private spaces, raising questions about the relevance of such a dichotomy altogether. For the lubunya community, the boundaries between home and activist spaces became increasingly blurred as most solidarity gatherings and even queer solidarity parties took place in the corporeal isolation of home spaces. With platforms like Zoom becoming central spaces of resistance, new power hierarchies emerged. For instance, ageing or disabled queers faced greater challenges in accessing certain activist circles, highlighting disparities within these virtual environments."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvbcfsm3gb2d4erd1kwhsd)

* "Benkler et al. (2015), who define these contemporary spaces of resistance as a “networked public sphere” derived from online-offline entanglements of the public with today’s “digitally networked” society or “networked publics” (Pink et al., 2016; Vivienne, 2016). These networked publics appear as groups of people organised around a social imaginary (or a discourse) that makes further political identifications and interactions possible (Warner, 2002)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvcex63ejm8qsx5f5bz5j7)

* "The growing literature on digital affordances provides effective ways to understand this connection by exploring online-offline entanglements in resistance cultures and the impacts of technological tools, such as hashtags and algorithms, to facilitate or contest resistance cultures"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvepfm1avqkx9553d35edz)

* "Informatics scholars introduced the term digital affordances to explain how technologies provide and enhance the potential for a particular action (Earl & Kimport, 2011; Majchrzak et al., 2013, p. 39). My take on the affordances is related to the assemblage theory, in which technological affordances are meaningful only through their relationality with bodies and spaces (Shaw & Sender, 2016). This approach assumes that human agency is important for alternating how certain technologies can be used, even outside their intended functions. Digital spaces can be queered just as offline spaces, in creating micro-communities or in producing queer knowledge online (Pain, 2022)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvfb6kk75w8v6ytbm68pw0)

* "This relationality makes the queer body into a more-than-human entanglement (Bates, 2017), using technology to transform what it has been initially intended to do within the constraints of a heteropatriarchal matrix."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvfw638wz4s97ner9ncr2y)

* "Hashtag activism has been a central way of doing networked resistance since the early 2010s. Oh, Eom and Rao (2015) name this function of hashtags “technolinguistic grammar” as they provide grammatical tools to bring together the messy interactions on social media and organise them for the continuity and mobilisation of discussions."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvg9z3fe3jbwvac36hrczt)

* "Their networked character also blurs the boundaries between public and private spaces, as spaces that would be considered private or personal can potentially be impactful in activism due to online connectivity. In this regard, the “networked public sphere” is a way to facilitate multi-scalar resistance through the affordances of digital platforms where everyday resistance practices and contentious politics may coincide."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvgw0f1cy6v4pf466srv39)

* "retrogressive personal narratives easily reaching hypervisibility online. In Turkey"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvjrrhadpdta7bmmq4nmhs)

* "A crucial outcome of cis-gendered, able-bodied and heterosexist norms that shape the standards of algorithms is “shadow banning” of marginalised online communities (Rauchberg, 2022). Ideologically biased algorithms threaten queer visibility on social media by categorising their contents as inappropriate"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvmy7rpa74t6tets3pm9ve)

* "networked publics are transformed into “refracted publics"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvnrmmgrswhhese0nah4ae)

* "novel spaces of resistance, not necessarily visible to the wider public but tactically hidden and subversive. I find the concept of the refracted public useful in describing how the lubunya movement sustains their networked resistance. According to Abidin, today’s refracted publics use subtle yet effective forms of connecting in digital spaces, shifting between politics of visibility and invented invisibility, depending on their political aims. She calls this tactic “silosociality”, which is based on affording visibility that is communal and localised in which “the content is tailor-made for specific subcommunities and rabbit-holes and may not be accessible or legible to outsiders” (Abidin, 2021, p. 4)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvqdxg1g1f48wx58m09ffj)

* "This approach directs my attention away from the reductionism of lubunya or queer identity as a static category and their predetermination as the only way of facilitating collective action."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvt474p6vhf1mmp522pwce)

* "Sedgwick (2003) criticises the poststructuralist focus on language as a primary source of knowledge and, instead, pays attention to affective interactions in seeking knowledge of resistance. Sedgwick deploys the term reparative reading, or a return to the ontology of intersubjectivity and community. Her affective ontology of the body helped me follow the traces of “becoming lubunya in action”—through bodily performances, online manifestations and vernacular formations. Moreover, Sedgwick argues that affect has a freedom of circulation between bodies. The very impossibility of preventing it from moving around makes affect highly contagious and, in many instances, attached. This can be seen as the reason for the ease of affective circulation to move between different scales of resistance: an everyday or individualised action can circulate affectively and eventually become transformative"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4yvvafs5nrcqd4jpde90s6y)

* "Massumi (2011), argues, from a Spinozian perspective, that affect is never in the present, but it is a movement between the past and the future. This is due to the capacitation of the body to carry the past affectively and imagine the future through these affects. Massumi argues:
  So there’s a reactivation of the past in passage toward a changed future, cutting transversally across dimensions of time, between past and future, and between pasts of different orders. This in-between time or transversal time is the time of the event. This temporality enables, and requires you, to rethink all of these terms – bodily capacitation, felt transition, quality of lived experience, memory, repetition, seriation, inclination – in dynamic relation to each other.

Here, queer is a horizon rather than an identity, something to be imagined and in the making that exceeds the limitations of current authoritarianism(s). This queer perspective commonly leads to a discussion on hope, where queer becomes a doing of politics of the unknown, creating possibilities for acting towards radical transformation.

Stanley writes that “trans/queer life is a threat that is so unimaginable that one is forced to not simply murder but to push the dead backward out of time, out of history, and into that which comes before” (p. 33, emphasis in original). Therefore, overkill describes a politics of hate and erasure that connotes a violence that is epistemic beyond that which is corporeal; it is an act to erase the queer memories and futures."
