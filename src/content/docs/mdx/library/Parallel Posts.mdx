* "I want to record them and their inalienable queerness before they are lost. Scholars can now look back on commonplace books and sentiment albums and see the quiet resistance of people reading from the margins to create new works; I have had the privilege of witnessing Parallel Posts grow in real time, and this thesis is document of that witnessing."

* "Parallel Posts emerged from a place of intersections, and in this thesis, I argue that the path forward for literary studies in the age of digital hyperconnectivity demands a similarly intersectional and interdisciplinary focus."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse6605g3mfg0r5dx750pzsa)

* "Parallel Posts were made and tagged with terms such as “parallels” and “comparatives” before oumaimas began making them. However, oumaimas was the person who gave Parallel Posts their now most-prominent name, “Web Weaving”, through her many 2019 Tumblr posts and her 2019 Medium essay, “My year of practicing tenderness”."

* "This idea of reading material as self-expression is wound through Parallel Posts."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse6fcwrd2psj335sjp45k22)
* "There has been little research on Parallel Posts thus far. They occupy part of Ester Frieder’s 2022 Honours thesis, and I have published two articles on the topic emerging from this thesis (Rose 2023; 2024). Freider takes Parallel Posts (or “Web Weaving”) as part of a broad “nomadic pedagogy” amongst “girlbloggers”, or young, marginalised Tumblr users who share knowledge. Lydia Wei discusses Parallel Posts as “identifiable with the queer community”, due to both the authors and texts most cited and the users who make Parallel Posts most often. Beyond this, Wei argues that through users’ efforts towards “finding queer voices throughout history”, Web Weaving presents an “alternative queer canon” (n.p.). She calls this “a type of excavation”, in which each individual Parallel Post is “an immersive experience of a given emotion” (n.p.)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse6gr6h3kc910c21jffqpsz)
* "in Parallel Posts, we see a broad network of bittersweet desire."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse6j8ra7srp9svspr13pg8e)
* "this “alternative canon” is of a broader sociological moment"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse6jpbddp5jbg94cmxzccmb)
* "a reorientation of what literary studies may come to “mean” in the digital age, granting equal focus to literary works and to the material, cultural, and political landscapes around them. Murray’s area of study is “the digital literary sphere” (2018), encompassing social sciences methodologies and emphasising the technological, sociocultural, and institutional factors which inform the creation and circulation of literature"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse6ke2kj9pnsj039kcbexm1)
* "I argue that Parallel Posts are as fundamentally fannish as they are bookish, for three key reasons:
  First, Parallel Posts are transformative works. The Organization for Transformative Works defines a transformative work as that which “takes something extant and turns it into something with a new purpose, sensibility, or mode of expression” (Organization for Transformative Works, n.d., n.p.). Parallel Posts are intertextual transformative works, drawing from different sources to create a whole artefact in the medium of Parallel Posts"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse6qzt2yp8e769fqb8f8xaj) ^d5a986
* "Parallel Posts are clearly transformative works."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse6rrz91jx0sd6ra62c3dcw)
* "labours of transformative transtextuality"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse6sb2qzj72f54n5ap9aa45) ^9666b6
* "a performance of cultural capital via engagement with literary work."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse72xj40sae7rca0eh4aaw9)
* "a knowledge culture that emphasises self-cultivation, “in direct opposition to formal literary education” and to the “gatekeeping” of literary knowledge (77)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse73b8sq1x0r66k76ts8v9h)
* "Woolf’s famous figure of the self-driven reader, who “epitomiz\[es] enthusiasm as well as autonomous thinking” (68), in “opposition to existing cultural mediators and arbiters of taste” (69)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse73tsc1v5anzvsqf9ak6gr)
* "the platform has been a source of “education” and knowledge-building since its inception."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse77eqx4zzjq8rhq64rywr4) ^d56dd4
* "Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin (2021) call Tumblr “informative, but through education rather than newsy ways” in contrast with other social media platforms (13). They attribute its success in this regard to being “not profile- based or legal name linked”, and largely disconnected from mainstream flows of commerce (13)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse781gjce864p3j89xsry6g) ^f04d44
* "On Tumblr, books are situated in a multimodal landscape, where images, audio, video, and text all combine to communicate"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse79gmc817qx7bsx02ep3rw) ^be56ce
* "Parallel Posts simply condense this multimodal shape into individual posts."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse79q8z1awf30taea2sxzas)
* "Mike Chasar (2012) has similarly argued that early 20th Century poetry scrapbooks were vital parts of poetry’s life and circulation in that era, with poetry taken as public “commons”;"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7d3m3pdjrwyr5x6kgwxtb)
* "Evan Hayles Gledhill (2018), too, gestures to older and concomitant practices of commonplace book-keeping, scrapbooking, and curating sentiment albums"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7djqev1g6jgsr6m8k74zz)
* "Commonplace books, scrapbooks, and sentiment albums are different forms of collaged manuscripts, or manuscripts used
  to collect quotes from other sources. Through this thesis, I suggest that Parallel Posts are a digital remediation of the collage manuscript form, most poignantly that of the commonplace book,"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7drwex59tbmgtca6sf5hd)
* "Comparisons between digital content curation and commonplace books are indeed commonplace: for example, Bob Whipple (2006) views the transition to storing photographs online as a form of commonplacing; Jill Rettberg (2014) presents commonplace books as pre-digital predecessors to Tumblr and Pinterest; Pauline Griffiths (2018) proposes commonplacing through blogs as a tool for school students developing personal voice; and on a broader, interpersonal scale, Simon Rowberry (2016) argues that the use of the “Kindle highlights” feature of the Kindle e- reader, in which users can see others’ highlighted phrases while reading, is akin to a collective commonplacing. Most relevant to this thesis is Gledhill’s (2018) argument that Tumblr as a whole, and specifically fandom on Tumblr, is reminiscent of the commonplace book or sentiment album."

* "Parallel Posts welcome the abundance that defines life under “digital hyperconnectivity” (Brubaker 2020) by drawing from many sources, and uniquely, they temper that abundance by fragmenting texts and further connecting them to others."

* "my methodological framework falls between that of literary analysis and digital ethnography (Ardévol and Gómez-Cruz 2013)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7h73x36yzvt8m6twj9mrt)

* "technologies of the self,"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7hrtpppsy1k2w6snkgef6)

* "Users establish their personal voice and priorities via tagging, much as curators made their commonplace books distinctive resources via indexing. Parallel Posts have become prominent due to the use of shared hashtags such as <span class="sl-obs-tag">#parallels</span>, <span class="sl-obs-tag">#comparatives</span>, and <span class="sl-obs-tag">#poetry</span>, but individuals often tag their posts in personal and complex ways that are legible only when looking at their blogs as unified wholes. The specificity of a user’s tags creates a semi-private sphere of discourse; their followers (or others
  viewing their blog as a whole) are a closed audience to the way a user interprets and arranges information over time. While the content of each post could be reblogged, the framing and significance of that content to the individual user remains private, contained in their ongoing use of tags."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7jjcb7ezcj4fy50cax7xq)

* "I excluded for analysis any posts featuring “do not reblog/do not interact” statements."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7mgt1hxqscef5s1hs2mzn)

* "the transience of online identity, in which the degree of tie between “real” identity and online identity varies user-to-user (see Gerrard 2022). Further, many users will change their usernames and online identities over time, thus making the name at any given moment in time and unstable referent (Gerrard 2022; Busse 2017b; see also Brooker, Duffett, and Hellekson 2017)."

* "Parallel Posts present the same concerns around diversity and Eurocentrism that Murray (2023), Adriaansen (2022), and thousands of internet users have discussed with regards to Dark Academia, and further research into Parallel Posts is required to explore their use in more diverse cohorts."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7rqxcfrm6kmbpr80q4m2y)

* "a high degree of literacy, cultural capital, and strong progressive political energy underpinning the work. Whether or not this is reflective of general trends amongst those who make Parallel Posts is unclear;"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7sds716fwe1r5wc2z1914)

* "Participant observation and content analysis were the core methods of this work, but I did not engage in participant interviews, a defining feature of ethnographic work as argued by Ardévol and Gómez- Cruz (2014; see also Cera 2023 and Forberg and Schilt 2023). Of the three main lineages of digital ethnography Ardévol and Gómez-Cruz (2014) outline, my approach aligns most with the media studies-informed “ethnographies of Internet in everyday life” (3), especially as focused on the
  impact of the digital on the “circuit of culture” and “the rise of a productive audience and the blurring between the spheres of production, distribution, and consumption”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7t37j7887nwswrytv5p54)

* "I followed the paths they set through their use of hashtags and their hyperlinking to other sites, tracing the affiliative networks that led to the development of their Parallel Posts."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7vy1dr5h5dfj32ch7y1bq)

* "the Parallel Post as a queer form in itself."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7ygvtba3f2w8r633yaw3n)

* "Across these case studies, Parallel Posts mirror commonplace books, particularly as they capture both the analytical processes and emotional experiences of their creators. As Jennifer Lei Jenkins (2015) argues, while commonplace books were initially associated with intellectual development, acting as “antholog\[ies] of ideas”, when they spread across classes and genders they took on the role of “album\[s] of emotions” (1379). Across ideas and emotions, they “codified curiosity” (1375), and I suggest that curiosity is the outstanding impression across all of these bloggers’ works: Parallel Posts capture processes of inquiry, exploration, and link-making."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse7zdjfc0ar0vkkbdxtx5hv)

* "These users collectively evidence a central claim of this thesis: that Parallel Posts not only fall into a broader history of curatorial technologies of the self, but into a new category: networked technologies of the self."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse80myh6ebrr8dezcqzyph9)

* "much disclosure online is not undertaken with the assumption of it being public, and researchers treating it as such is both disrespectful and dangerous."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse81szjfv9nmm5mz09fcbdt)

* "self-curation in the context of neoliberal “digital hyperconnectivity” (Brubaker 2020) and argue that Parallel Posts are technologies of the self (Foucault 1988),"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse83bgbf9pxm63jwkge358w)

* "Parallel Posts mirror commonplace books and sentiment albums, as filtered through Tumblr’s affordances, subcultures, and unique approaches to multimodality"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse8496gb4va66g53hgy7dmk)

* "I suggest that commonplace books, sentiment albums, Tumblr blogs, and Parallel Posts are “curatorial technologies of the self”, in which one self-acculturates and self-performs through textual collage."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jse84natp0wbwf0ym3nfyzad) ^eb4287

* "Tumblr being a key site of political and social discourse for young people and its extensive influence on broader internet culture (Tiffany 2023; Stein 2017),"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jt8wxmr1rm66vsrw90ws3sd6) ^f2b5bd

* "user control over the content and layout of their Tumblr was prioritised from the start, with Karp saying, “The magic of Tumblr is we let you put anything in and get it out any way you want” (in McCracken et al. 2020: 4)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jt8wyywamf2zx4sv5pd15pba)

* "Tumblr quickly gained traction as an artists’ and writers’ space, and as a space of media fandom, left-wing activism, and queer, feminist, and broadly counterpublic gathering (McCracken et al. 2020; Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin 2021; Stein 2017; Oakley and Dame-Griff 2020)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jt8wzgezems4rwyth2d01hxr) ^8263e6

* "2018 “porn ban”, in which all pornographic, sexual, and sex educational material was removed from the site, including vast quantities of queer content that were not “NSFW” (not suitable for the workplace). This disenfranchised Tumblr’s queer and trans userbase and sex workers who used Tumblr professionally (McCracken et al. 2020; Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin 2021)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jt8x0jz60jfnvk06y75rsrec)

* "McCracken et al. (2020) present Tumblr as a diffuse grouping of “disparate people com\[ing] together over mutual passions and desires in a queer, carnival-like atmosphere that distinctly dispenses with normalcy” (2). They take Tumblr as “a more egalitarian, nonhierarchical, uncensored media environment” than other mainstream platforms, especially appealing to “those who did not want to be easily surveilled or identified” (5). Anonymity and the possibility for self- performance are taken as integral parts of the site’s affordances."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jt8x128k6q2wjm78e0fk19gz)

* "Tumblr allows the categorisation of posts through hashtags both internally to a user’s own blog and through the site as a whole."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jt8x55bgr0jjm6kj7frt4dkc)

* "Stein (2017) argues that specific communities (such as fandoms) deliberately create hashtags that hold meaning only inside their own group, allowing for a “private-in-public” structure of posting (89). Many users, however, use tags discursively or expressively contrary to indexically – at one extreme, posts can be entirely without content, with a user writing “in the tags” instead. Stein notes that tags on Tumblr can be used “to create poetry, analysis, conversation, and even fiction” (89)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jt8x5t17fqfr85hp6hexzrac)

* "“ambient affiliation”, or the way that a sense of public conversation or shared space can build internal to a digital space, such as a hashtag thread, between people who are not directly connected to one another. The sharing and repetitions of post through different communities leads to a feeling of ambient affiliation, which allows users to perceive Tumblr as a whole and unified community."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jt8x8c0vet8z6d8ke304qf99)

* "Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin (2021) argue that Tumblr’s temporality is highly nonlinear, largely because of the reblog – posts can be continuously circulated for years, alive in the public consciousness; “die” unobserved immediately; or die and be reborn years later. This facilitates a pervasive sense of ephemerality and timelessness (45)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jt8x97zsv7808tmmzjgc1229)

* "The reblog feature, and the rolling intertextual communication that the reblog facilitates, allowed for the Parallel Post as a form that multiple users could contribute to. Tumblr’s normalisation of quoted, referenced, and hyperlinked material made a quotational medium a viable trend. The multiple methods of access to Tumblr – personal to the user, specific to another’s blog, or facilitated through the use of hashtags – allowed users to find each other through affiliative networks, through immersion in specific users’ blogs, or through collectivising hashtag threads."
