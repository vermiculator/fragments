* "To what extent do external objects and processes constitute part of the mind"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb4vnw80abb6ha24zznmre7)

* "For an accessible and cogent overview and history, we highly recommend Michaelian and Sutton (2013), which used the banner term distributed cognition."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb4w3nzekvxmyqn3jnz04av)

* ". Another helpful point of entry is Wilson’s (2002) description of six differ- ent views on the term embodied cognition (compare especially views 3 and 4: “we offload cognitive work onto the environment” vs. “the environment is part of the cognitive system”)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb4wm9j5ywyxyqxb87pgdc2)

* ", Clark and Chalmers (1998) proposed the idea of the extended mind: the human mind extends into the world, because parts of the world function as parts of our cognitive systems (extended cognition)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb4x2aaj5qmr339db3z3q7y)

* "There has been much debate over whether external objects and processes truly con- stitute part of cognition (the hypothesis of extended cognition, HEC; e.g., Clark, 2010) or are merely being coupled with a cognitive agent (the hypothesis of embed- ded cognition, HEMC; e.g., Adams & Aizawa, 2010; Rupert, 2004). See Menary (2010a, Figure 10.1) for one attempt to reconcile the two views."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb4xhwhmyxe8cv02j9hhx2e)

* "we integrate external objects and processes that complement rather than duplicate our internal abilities."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb4y472d36hj0nzgjwq6mzf)

* "Tools enhance thinking (Dennett, 2000), and using them is one way we transform difficult problems into easier ones (Sterelny, 2004)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb4ybsehsghv66s6f18amrb)

* "Internal and external compo- nents of a cognitive system can “play different roles and have different properties while coupling in collective and complementary contributions to flexible thinking and acting” (Sutton, 2010, p. 194)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb4yr3p9dq7yvyqk3wb2a4p)

* "Heersmink (2013) proposed a taxonomy of cognitive artifacts, which he defined as “human-made, physical objects that functionally contribute to performing a cog- nitive task.” He proposed three types of representational cognitive artifacts: iconic (e.g., map), indexical (e.g., compass), and symbolic (e.g., abacus); he also proposed two types of nonrepresentational (ecological) cognitive artifacts: spatial (e.g., car keys placed on the counter) and structural (e.g., shapes in Tetris)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb4z8c3tcsy28wv54wye27e)

* "Heersmink (2015) also outlined possible dimensions of integration, including information flow, reliability, durability, trust, procedural transparency, informational transparency, individualization, and transformation."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb4zt1j5r5dg302qa0n77yh)

* "Clowes (2013) provided a thoughtful discussion of the possible effects on humans of transitioning from low-tech external memory to high-tech external mem- ory (which he calls E-Memory), in the context of both the HEC and HEMC philo- sophical views. He pointed out that the answer to the question of whether increased reliance on external memory diminishes us as people depends on whether we think of external memory as part of our selves (HEC) or not (HEMC). The former implies a mere reconfiguration of the cognitive agent, the latter a diminishment."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb511hpgjf62y1nztrjeyem)

* "Dynamic/dynamical systems theory (see also complex systems, cybernetics) is an approach for understanding a system in which multiple components continuously and simultaneously influence each other over time."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb55nz2ngmb1mhtpvkftetd)

* ". For a good introduction to dynamic systems theory in the context of cognition, see Clark (2001, Chapter 7) and van Gelder and Port (1995)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb55y1fvnqvw1v3xh3wm8ap)

* "Across time, a dynamic system moves on trajectories through a space of possible states. The system may converge toward a subset of state space known as an attrac- tor or away from a subset of state space known as a repellor"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb56bpks5h1qheh0k5benp3)

* "s. Components in a system can be joined in causal feedback loops that are positive (e.g., an arms race) or negative (e.g., the relationship between eating and hunger). Broadly, we can conceive of internal and external memory in a nega- tive feedback loop: the more reliable and efficient one component, the less the other component is used. This is only a very basic example of how dynamic systems theory may be useful for studying the interplay of internal and external memory."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb56ypfhpk2akjac83eptq2)

* "The landscape of one’s internal memory over time may be governed by attractors and repellors. That is, it may be shaped by factors such as what is easy to save and revisit in external memory, what emotions and stories one most wants to preserve, and what the environment readily reminds one of."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb575he4150nqkrx650jzwp)

* "Dynamic systems theory may be useful for the study of external memory in a variety of other ways, for example, formalizing theories to account for distributed cognitive processes"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb57h2ym7pd6m6y3kqf2wnd)

* "Heylighen (2016) described the useful concept of stigmergy: a coordination mechanism whereby an action (e.g., writing) leaves a trace in a medium (e.g., paper) which then prompts further action (e.g., more writing). However, both Hutchins (2010) and Clark (1997, 2008) warn that the dynamic systems approach by itself may be inadequate to account for real-­ world intelligent actions involving humans."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5928dsv4p9wz62m3m1y9n)

* "PIM “refers to both the practice and the study of the activities people perform in order to acquire, organize, maintain and retrieve information for every- day use” (Jones & Bruce, 2005)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb59eg8sfrhztef7gj4kpk5)

* "We recommend the following as overall refer- ences: Bergman and Whittaker (2016), Jones (2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015), Jones and Teevan (2007), Marshall (2008a, 2008b), and Whittaker (2011)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb59t4y3e7qhgb3v837zp08)

* "PIM also addresses the challenges of managing multiple information forms or types, just as we have discussed low-tech versus high-tech external mem- ory. Jones (2007) proposed a personal space of information: an amorphous set of information that a person can access (or should be able to access) and that is per- sonal in one or more of the following ways: is possessed by the person, is about them, is directed toward them, is sent by them, was experienced by them but no longer possessed by them (e.g., library books), and/or is relevant to them."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5akqywd93mccjb10j7ns3)

* "Note that this conception includes both episodic and semantic forms of external memory. Note also that there are several other dimensions implicit in this concep- tion: who or what created the information (e.g., oneself, another person, or an auto- mated process; cf. Hertel, 1993; and reality monitoring notions from Johnson & Raye, 1981), who is the intended audience of the information, and who or what is the subject of the information."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5bejxf2m2dtanhn20hgey)

* "Jones (2007) furthermore proposed that people engage in three major types of PIM activities: keeping, finding/refinding, and meta-level activities."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5btyphdtzsn0gehkb6g3q)

* "By our inter- pretation, keeping is the encoding of information into external memory. Finding is the retrieval of new information from external memory. Refinding is the retrieval of previously encountered information from external memory, and this activity may be guided by some internal memory of the previous encounter (e.g., approximately when and where the information was last encountered). Meta-level activities per- formed on a personal space of information include organizing (e.g., using a folder structure or file tagging scheme), maintaining (e.g., backing up files, updating file"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5c8mgr21rjxq8xhkzc22c)

* "formats, synching information across devices), managing privacy and the inbound and outbound flow of information, and evaluating the efficacy of one’s own PIM activities."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5cdk1naz1az7erh6ky6np)

* "Jones saw the purpose of PIM activities as mapping between needs (i.e., goals) and information."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5cj0nqd9yz14q9ympbgr4)

* "Whittaker (2011) offered an alternative framework of PIM activities, based on a curation life cycle: keeping, management, and exploitation. He saw exploitation as specifically applied to personal information that one has already kept, whereas Jones’s conception of finding/refinding could also apply to public information."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5cz42q18her16sawp61rb)

* "finding information in external memory appears to often be a multistep process (Jones & Ross, 2007; Lansdale, 1988; Teevan, Capra, & Quiñones, 2007): remembering to look (a challenge that is sometimes met by leaving piles of information as visible reminders), recalling enough about the desired information to initiate navigation or search (e.g., a general location such as the purple filing cabinet or a search term like “wedding photos”), and then recognizing the desired information among candidates returned by the recall-directed search. These last two steps are similar to the generate-recognize strategy for internal memory retrieval (Watkins & Gardiner, 1979)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5dwcjs7d0d75c8ez0b19v)

* "With external memory retrieval, the recall and recognize steps may need to be repeated in itera- tions, for example, if the initial search returned too many or too few results"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5e3bwmma6m5b2h9qpv36n)

* "sometimes we simply browse external memory to reminisce, rather than trying to find something specific."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5eft7kzf7m3hyb8a048p8)

* "Keeping (i.e., encoding) is also a multifaceted activity, involving decisions about whether some new piece of information is worth saving for the future (a signal detection task; Jones, 2004) and decisions about where and how to keep it. Such decisions are difficult because they require us to predict the needs and contexts of our future selves (cf. Bjork, 1994; Mäntylä & Nilsson, 1988; Rhodes, 2016; Tullis & Benjamin, 2015) and to weigh the costs of keeping too much (interfering with retrieval of relevant information, distraction) against the costs of keeping too little (not having information we end up needing). Whittaker (2011) provided an excel- lent review of research on keeping practices for several information formats, includ- ing paper, email, contacts, webpages, and photos. He also pointed out several factors that influence our keeping decisions, such as uniqueness (privately made items vs. publicly available), whether an item is actionable or not, and loss aversion (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5f5p7swajzvf5tkza9fqm)

* "people tend to keep more information than they use, especially with digital technology (photos: Whittaker, Bergman, & Clough, 2010; email: Dabbish, Kraut, Fussell, & Kiesler, 2005)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5fjj7xs12ag582zfndfd2)

* "Whether such “overkeeping” is a bad thing depends"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5fr075ne7vm4xbsec0fky)

* "on one’s view of the purpose of external memory (the two first authors of this book enjoy disagreeing about this)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5g0e443qt9mn5nd2hk5k4)

* "r"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5g1bxsyqvjmztecghs80t)

* ". Reasons for keeping found by Marshall and Bly (2005) were useful future reference, remind- ers for action, evoking internal episodic memories, and sharing. Reasons for keep- ing found by Kaye et al. (2006) were finding information later, building a legacy, sharing resources, insuring against loss, and identity construction. Note that we may sometimes keep information without the intention of specifically searching for it again, but rather as mementos which may incidentally remind us of an experience if we ever happen to come across them"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5grhnqm8ma9cef3hnv7f6)

* "Whatever the intentions at the time of encoding information to external memory, the organization used will impact any future retrieval attempts. For external mem- ory, encoding is much easier than retrieval."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5hb5f3072yda6wmt8t5q3)

* "In human history, the development of new external memory technologies, from cuneiform tablets to digital libraries, has followed a pattern: an explosion of encoded information followed by belated scram- bling efforts to improve organization and facilitate retrieval (Blair, 2010; Rumsey, 2016; Taylor & Joudrey, 2008, pp. 67–88; Thompson, 2013, pp. 115–146; Whittaker et al., 2010)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5hvkzgghxypmkb49d8pfs)

* "external memory does not inherently forget, which would act as a check on the volume of information amassed (Locke, 2000; Mayer-Schönberger, 2011). Thus, organization is crucial."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5j3b6h5ths5a56wz2py3q)

* "Organization practices vary across individuals, task characteristics, and information formats (Gwizdka & Chignell, 2007; Malone, 1983). Often organization efforts are only made at the time of encoding; we rarely take the time to overhaul our entire organizational systems, unless prompted by extrinsic events such as a move or a new job (Whittaker, 2011, p. 17). People do not seek to optimize their external memory tools but rather are more likely to satisfice (Simon, 1956)—that is, to adjust their system so it is just good enough to meet their short-term goals."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5k05q7t43tr3rj0zbn962)

* "Two common organization strategies implemented at encoding are filing and pil- ing (Malone, 1983). Filing is the placing of items into a carefully constructed hier- archical folder structure. This can assist retrieval by providing a coherent well-labeled structure to navigate, which can work well for specific projects (e.g., planning a wedding), but less so for general future reference. Filing requires upfront effort and is vexed by the problem that we are generally not good at using labels consistently (Lansdale, 1988). This is in part due to the ambiguity of language (Dumais & Landauer, 1983), and in part due to the fact that items can be classified in multiple ways, and we may not use the same classification or keyword labels at the time of encoding and the time of retrieval."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5m6fe538wydsss3txe6kj)

* "The multidimensional representations of internal memory (Rosch, 1978) can be difficult to implement in external memory."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5mdgnbzpj2ex3292t0d71)

* "As opposed to filing, piling is the placing of similar items into piles that have no deeper structure. These piles, especially physical ones, require less upfront effort than filing and can have the advantage of keeping information visible and exploiting our internal memory for spatial location (Lansdale, 1991). However, this comes at the cost of eventual clutter and visual distraction."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzb5mxmrqf1bmt9n2fe0h4vp)

* "bels used in external memory are typically a reflection of the user’s categories in internal memory (Jones & Ross, 2007)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbcmeqmpzp360yse28rmxvd)

* "New technological tools may automate some of the burden of keeping and orga- nizing (e.g., automatic keyword generation or face recognition for photos), but hav- ing to manually handle those very burdens promotes our internal memory representations of our external memory stores (Jones & Ross, 2007). External mem- ory systems that actively engage the human user could circumvent this fault (e.g., Catarci, Dong, Halevy, & Poggi, 2007; Jones, 1986)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbcs0qatphpe6kkwcew1ke4)

* "he way the information is displayed can facilitate or impede our use of it. Research on visualization is thus also important for external memory."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbcxf3138dk3rc8g8j4xr69)

* "en more challenges arise when curating personal archives for the very long term (for an excellent overview, see Marshall, 2008a, 2008b). Marshall (2011) pointed out that most people take an approach of “benign neglect” to personal archiving, which may be sufficient for small volumes of low-tech external memory (e.g., books on a shelf, photos in a box), but is less so for large volumes and for high-tech external memory. This is in part because of the insidious challenges of digital preservation (e.g., hardware and software obsolescence, media degradation; see Anbu & Chibambo, 2009; Borgman, 2000, pp. 202–205; Kuny, 1998; Oliver & Harvey, 2016)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbd0mqbbbt372wesfj3esqe)

* "no"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbczdhvw02f343hh8757k0v)

* "t only do people forget particular items that they’ve saved; they also forget entire categories of saved material or places that they’ve stored treasured items (Bruce, Jones, & Dumais 2004; Marshall & Bly 2005; Whittaker & Sidner 1996)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbczkrf7rqjm5fzrstypr9e)

* (Marshall, 2007, pp 64-65)

* "nformation fragmentation. The totality of one’s personal archive is distributed across physical and electronic stores, multiple devices or locations, and multiple information forms or organization schemes (Jones, 2007; Weinberger, 2007)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbd2mkhkexr9vdjrdyp142v)

* "Information fragmentation makes it harder to find specific information when we need it and harder to consolidate information. The problem can be compounded when we fail to remember that (or find where) we have already saved something, and thus we save it again in a different place."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbd3803gmsvqr3f64h80x4m)

* "For a review of social issues with PIM, see Lutters, Ackerman, and Zhou (2007) and Jones (2013)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbd3ztf10xqzs2cqvy4k9s5)

* "Lifelogging is the automatic recording of many aspects of everyday experience and may include data from wearable cameras and biological sensors ("  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbd4xk713pb3cdjveqzy7er)

* I'm actively ignoring this kind of data capture - overly quantitative focus and little instrumental value to outweigh ethical and practical considerations

* "Whereas the field of personal information management deals with personal external memory, library and information science (LIS) deals more with public external memory (e.g., libraries, archives, museum collections, the Internet)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbd8jakfx9rw3mz28ga55dj)

* "White (1992) actually used the term “external memory” as a unifying concept for the field of LIS (see Hartel, 2012 for a helpful review). White defined external mem- ory as “the creation, organization and use of messages or performances stored in durable media other than the memories of living persons” (p. 250)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbdgsw0ns3d2rd694skhysj)

* "LIS is more concerned with formal actions taken by professionals, such as acquisition and cataloging, rather than everyday actions."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbdhmzp1150nbsbxjmxv4eb)

* "For external memory stores such as libraries, encoding is much more closely tied to explicit organizational processes than is the case with internal memory"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbdj1n2cwwfnf1m58a0twhe)

* "Metadata is a useful concept for the interplay of internal and external memory. In order to use external memory, we must retain inter- nal representations of some metadata about external memory records. For example, we do not have to remember the complete contents of a research article we have read, only a rough idea of what it was about and enough information to be able to find it again (e.g., perhaps an author’s name, or a fragment of the title, or which folder we might have saved the PDF in). The concept of source memory is essen- tially memory for metadata."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzbdk8afxgfy698pfadcg72e)

* ". Case and Given (2016, pp. 79–96) reviewed work on people’s motivations for seeking infor- mation (e.g., seeking answers, reducing uncertainty, and making sense). Case and Given (2016, pp. 141–176) also gave detailed descriptions of several models of information-seeking behavior. For example, Krikelas (1983) proposed a model in which an information seeker with an immediate information need can choose between internal memory, social external memory, and technological external mem- ory. Kuhlthau (1991) proposed a model accounting for the feelings, thoughts, and actions a person has at different stages of the information search process. Similar approaches have also been adopted by some cognitive scientists (cf. “information foraging”: Fu, 2012; Fu & Pirolli, 2007). Information seeking does not always con- sist of targeted search. Just as we may browse through our old photos or social media posts for aimless reminiscing, we may also browse or scan public external memory and encounter information serendipitously (Case & Given, 2016, pp. 105– 107; Toms, 1999). When engaging in such behavior, we are in a state analogous to what Tulving (1983, pp. 169–171) called “retrieval mode,” a state of mind in which one is prepared to remember. Studies of how and why people seek information can be beneficial to the design of external memory tools such as digital libraries (e.g., Borgman et al., 2005)."

For a review of research on Wikipedia as the “sum of all human knowledge,” see Mesgari, Okoli, Mehdi, Nielsen, and Lanamäki (2015).

See also folksonomies (Mathes, 2004; Vander Wal, 2007).

A single quipu consisted of knots tied on a series of small cords attached to one large cord. Different types of knots could represent numerical values, and the order and color of the small cords could represent different categories of objects (e.g., types of livestock in a herd or types of soldiers in an army). However, only specially trained officers could decode these cues to retrieve the information.
  Prayer beads have been a widespread form of external memory used for centuries by many religions to guide adherents in the recitation of prayer cycles. Evidence of religious use of beads dates back at least as far as Hindu sculptures from 185 B.C.E. (Dubin, 2009, pp. 79–92). The beads do not encode the actual contents of the prayers, but rather form a scaffold of reminders to guide internal memory. Beads are held in one or two hands, and the fingers are passed over the beads as the prayer cycle progresses. Many prayer cycles include repetitions of certain segments. The feel of a particular bead cues adherents to move on to the next part of the prayer cycle. Thus the beads alleviate the need to keep internal track of the number of rep- etitions, freeing adherents to either clear their mind or focus on the content of the prayers."
