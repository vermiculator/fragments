* productivity > production > creation > theological under Judeo-Christian theology, it's mostly rearranging, mending, tending, etc - 'male labour' made equivalent to childbirth, the literal productive labour... and then the mending, tidying, rearranging etc actually left to women regardless.. so 'productivity' inherently theological and patriarchal pg 222
* Carlyle's 'gospel of work'/producerism
* as is 'service' as a prerequisite to becoming a full adult [children's rights](/mdx/earth/childrens-rights) [ascension to adulthood](/mdx/earth/ascension-to-adulthood)
* Wage labour in middle ages as 'something respectable people engaged in only in the first phase of their working life' service where you learnt the trade and the 'manners', then you become self employed -- vs now how self-employment is for the elite
* 'the poor were seen as frustrated adolescents ''work - and specifically, paid labour under the eye of a master - had traditionally been the means by which such adolescents learned how to be proper, disciplined, self-contained adults'
* 'work, {they: the puritans} taught, was both punishment and redemption." Labour becoming not the source of wealth but concentrated capital Harry Braverman - 'source of status.. no longer the ability to make things but simply the ability to purchase them'
* 'Nowadays, if one speaks of "wealth producers" people will automatically assume one is referring not to workers but to capitalists' Pg 234
* 'rich people don't have to learn how to do interpretive labour nearly as well because they can hire other people to do it for them'
* Don't know if quoting Marx or free prose : ' the world we inhabit is something we made, collectively, as a society, and therefore, that we could also have made differently'
* John Holloway 'stop making capitalism' in how we keep reproducing the very thing we are under
* 'To maintain a world relatively predictable on which caring takes place' 'the love for others .. regularly required the maintenance of institutional structures one might otherwise despise'
* If you want to pursue value, EG truth and justice, and actually want to be paid a living wage, then you HAVE to possess family wealth, social networks, cultural capital. This is what the 'liberal elite' is
* Maybe a multi-live-streamed sit-in wage/working standards protest as a form of general strike for universal basic income or similar
* African Americans and migrants in US, education still most likely advancement, poor whites see them as 'unfairly in alliance with rich white liberals'
* Only value-based option for poor whites is church based or military based
* Soldiers doing public services, most soldiers actually wanted to be in the peace corps but the peace corps requires an existing college degree
* Robotised creatives, that is to say AI making its 'living' on creative pursuit, that is to say mix-matching other stuff into new art and choosing mediums and projects and insights eg from data mining, and we consider how useful those insights are according to value models
* On robotisisation- We want robots for 'caring' work to be predictably unpredictable, such that they have a history and a personality, such that we might as well negate the labour of developing them and just have humans do the work
* You can't really strike care work
* 'Human life is a process by which we, as humans, create one another; even the most extreme individualists only become individuals through the care and support of their fellows; and "the economy" is ultimately just the way we provide ourselves with the necessary material provisions with which to do so'
* Pg269 onwards on basic universal income
* 'money is .. a rationing ticket' - pg 281
* 'all of the gratuitous sadism of workplace politics depends on ones inability to say "I quit" and feel no economic consequences." Pg 283
