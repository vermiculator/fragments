* "four discourses have emerged: data as an asset, data as latent knowledge, data as a technology of governing, and data as resistance. These four discourses align with Deleuze and Guattari’s capitalist, territorial, statist, and nomadic social formations, respectively."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0cjkhscvqwh0wq2eq3g87kj)

* "The social forms exist in reciprocal relationship to and are the aggregates of concrete assemblages"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0cjm846q32gjm1p0w4226ny)
* "opportunity to interrogate dominant conceptualisations of Big Data before they become embedded in our everyday lives ‘foreclosing alternative possibilities’. Dalton and Thatcher (2014) exhorted that it is a characteristic of all successful technologies that our attention on them dissipates as they become normalised."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0cjp6a5b03jq0nkfqvbmjzr)
* "data as an economic asset, data as means to create knowledge, data as a technology of governing, and data governance subjects resisting subjugation and claiming the value and power of their data for themselves. It will demonstrate how categorising data discourses in this four-part framework can be used to link up the CDS corpus both conceptually and methodologically via Deleuze and Guattari’s assemblage theory."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0cjqchsyajwrdtwqjxe9qbf)
* "a procedural approach that follows how the discourses manifest through the creation of data, insights, and their use within concrete assemblages. Finally, the paper outlines how combining these two analytic approaches could be employed as the first two steps of Deleuze and Guattari’s assemblage analysis."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0cjvdyh611f26fqwebnf796)
* "CDS ‘applies critical social theory to data’ (Kitchin and Lauriault 2014). It challenges the naive assumption that data are ‘neutral, objective, independent, raw representations of the world’ (Kitchin and Lauriault, 2014; also see Iliadis and Russo, 2016: 1; boyd and Crawford, 2012: 667; Dalton and Thatcher, 2014). Rather data are regarded as subjective, ‘situational, contingent, relational, contextual’ and doing ‘active work in the world’ (Kitchin and Lauriault, 2014). Data is an expression of power (D’lgnazio and Klein, 2020; Iliadis and Russo, 2016; Kitchin and Lauriault, 2014)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0cjw4k2jsh2q6ryx66p10hh)

Data is often seen as property—something to be owned—with disputes, and increasingly, regulation to designate who has ownership rights (Birch, Cochrane and Ward, 2021: 3-4; Kitchin and Lauriault, 2014).

* "quantification of the material world of, for example, people, spaces, events, materials; labelled 'datafication' (Van Dijck, 2014: 198 referring to Mayer-Schönberger and Cukier, 2013). The second pass is the monetisation of the data (if sold or licensed); the data itself is in some instances quantified (Van Dijck, 2014: 200-1). However, Birch, Cochrane and Ward (2021) argue that, regarding personal data captured by Big Tech firms, users are monetised rather than the data per se (4)."

It includes a debate about the scope of data analytics in helping us to understand the world; whether it can enable us to be all-knowing or is limited to a subset of questions ignoring those related to, for example, meaning, politics, and ethics (Kitchin, 2014a: 8).

* "he idea that data science transcends human analytic capabilities extends to the notion that data holders can know you better than you know yourself (Zuboff, 2019: 163). In the commercial sphere, the ideal is to anticipate and seamlessly satisfy consumers needs and wants 'before they are fully formed' (Fourcade and Healy, 2017). To do this, 'the market sees you from within, measuring your body and emotional states, and watching you as you move around your house, the office, or the mall' (Fourcade and Healy, 2017: 23)."

* "ata as resistance There are two ways of framing this discourse. Either reactively as a discourse of resistance in opposition to the logic or singular pursuit of the other three discourses. Alternatively, it can be framed actively as 'data as agency' (see Kennedy, Poell and Van Dijck, 2015; Smith, 2016: 267, 280). That is, the governed claiming the enhanced agency and value provided by the data, including its potential monetary, knowledge producing or governance value (Kennedy, Poell and Van Dijck, 2015; Micheli et al., 2020; Pybus, Coté and Blanke, 2015)."

* "Corporate resistance in the interests of data subjects includes industry calls for greater regulation and technological giants (e.g. Amazon, IBM) resisting government access to data created on their platforms, for example, police access to their facial recognition technology (Magid, 2020; O’Loughlin and Bukowitz, 2021: 1). Another industry response supporting data subject resistance has been the emergence of competitor services that prioritise privacy (Hodge, 2021)."

* "The ‘data imperative’ is to create commodities that generate data in an unceasing flow (Sadowski, 2019: 4). To resist any restriction on this flow, corporate datafication has leveraged similar tactics developed for financial capital, such as avoiding oversight through opaque technologies and avoiding regulation through political influence (Sadowski, 2019: 5, 9)."

* "Kitchin (2014a) juxtaposes empiricist programs with data-driven science (including positivist and post-positivist forms), and knowledge-driven or purely deductive science (1-5). Rather than rejecting Big Data approaches, Kitchin (2014a) makes a bid for an epistemological framing that acknowledges research’s inherent politics and is situated, reflexive, and contextualised (9)."

* "Beer (2016) draws primarily on Foucault and Hacking to illustrate Big Data’s social and conceptual origins in statistics (also see Ruppert, Isin and Bigo, 2017: 3). Statistics emerged in the early nineteenth century as an important component of population governance by states through intense categorisation and the concepts of normalcy and deviancy (Beer, 2016: 3). ‘These emerging numbers quickly came to define how people saw themselves’ and ‘how limits and boundaries were placed around actions and opportunity’ (Beer, 2016: 3).

* "ollowing the logic of a metaphysics of continuity, things must be animated internally or immanently (in Deleuze and Guattari’s terms by ‘desire’) rather than externally by a transcendent universal law, truth, or direction (Adkins, 2015: 2-3)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0en1hd1d6t8t87zenq421vh)

* "From their ethical perspective, universals are illegitimate illusions of transcendence and capture that separate us from our power to act (Smith, 2011: 125-6; also see Buchanan, 2008: 73); points of fixation that masquerade as immutable to channel power in particular directions."

* "Social formations—the focus of this section—are no ‘different in kind’ than concrete assemblages, except that they are ‘determined by historical conditions’ and are ‘desire on a social scale’ (Buchanan, 2008: 95-6"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0en4p2dpw7rgacqjgq34xh3)
* "). In Anti- Oedipus, Deleuze and Guattari refer to the capitalist, territorial, and statist forms as being ’molar’; however, not concerning scale, but use the term molar to refer to a tendency towards stasis and the discrete (Adkins, 2015: 48; also see 40-1 and Buchanan, 2008: 24-5). ‘Molecular’, in contrast, is a tendency towards fluidity and the continuous (Adkins, 2015: 48). Deleuze and Guattari (1983) describe capitalist, statist, and territorial assemblages or social forms as the statistical molar aggregates of concrete assemblages (183; Buchanan, 2008: 90). Concrete assemblages (or desiring-machines) both constitute these social forms and are shaped and permeated by them (Buchanan, 2008: 90-1; Deleuze and Guattari, 1983: 183). Social formations and concrete assemblages never exist independent of each other but in a reciprocal relationship (Buchanan, 2008: 90-1; Deleuze and Guattari, 1983: 183)."

The task is not to classify and judge, for example dividing things into ‘bad’ statist things and ‘good’ nomadic things (Adkins, 2015: 191). Rather, the ‘project of becoming, of creating the new, begins with seeing the nomadic in everything’ (Adkins, 2015: 13)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ept2psnttxbkpmxvmkazp1)

* ". In A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari add a fifth social form, the networked and polarising urban centre (Adkins, 2015: 220). Deleuze and Guattari would not advocate that you accept their analysis of the four or however many social formations as the last word, quite the contrary. What is most pertinent is the methodological approach (Buchanan, 2008: 65). They encourage us to consider a nomadic science alongside a statist science; the former in which ‘axioms are not settled once and for all’ but ‘can also be the starting points for experimentation’ (Adkins, 2015: 228)."

* "). The territorial assemblage ‘attempts to ward off the chaos of a meaningless world’ by classifying and qualitatively ‘coding’ or giving meaning to elements (e.g. persons, objects, words) and defining their ‘nature’, or proper purpose (Buchanan, 2008: 94; Nail, 2017: 29). The remaining uncoded elements—the residual code that falls outside the classification system—are blocked from attaching to the assemblage through, for example, prohibition and taboo, and boundaries are formed, e.g. borders of towns, boundaries to gender identities (Nail, 2017: 29; also see Buchanan, 2008: 96-7). These ‘abstract relations change, but only one concrete element at a time…like a game of leapfrog. They set up some limits and by doing so create a new limit to cross…in a perpetual disequilibrium making its very dysfunction an essential element of its ability to function…Change happens progressively, one concrete point at a time’ (Nail: 2017: 30)."

* "Coding ’is not enough by itself to produce an enduring social machine’; relationships including alliances and affiliations are also required (Buchanan, 2008: 99). Alliances attempt to prevent the incorporation or ‘fusion’ of the uncoded elements by redistributing this residual or ‘surplus code’ (Nail, 2017: 29-30).

* "Deleuze and Guattari do not specifically relate these territorial processes to knowledge creation, but for Deleuze and Guattari, territorial assemblages are about meaning making. As noted in the earlier discussion, discourse is a process and struggle to fix meaning and define truth in the interests of certain power blocs or alliances.

* "his specialised body brings the elements ’into resonance around a \[vertical and hierarchical] centralized point of transcendence’ (Nail, 2017: 30; additions not in original). It exerts controls or an apparatus of capture, also known as ‘overcoding’ (Adkins, 2015: 221-2). For instance, territory is overcoded as land or property such that ‘different properties are now comparable to one another’, that is ‘in terms of the rent they’ll support’ (Adkins, 2015: 222). This overcoding has the effect of cutting elements off from their relations to other elements (Nail, 2017: 30)—i.e. people’s historical connection to place, community and land based subsistence, and controlling their new connections, e.g. to taxed work—‘and in this way extracts its required surplus value’ (Buchanan, 2008: 105)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0eq2x8q7qhc26bfs5j28whh)
