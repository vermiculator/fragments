* ""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind." He posits that human consciousness is only about 3,000 years old. [Before humans mastered language](http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/consciousness-began-when-the-gods-stopped-speaking)— meaning we understood metaphors, comparisons and differences of perspective — we didn't have what we recognize today as basic consciousness, or the ability to self-reflect. Instead, Jayne says, thoughts occurred to us and we obeyed the thoughts without question, believing that we were receiving orders from some higher authority."

* "Characters in the earlier "Iliad" had no introspection, no tendency to ask why; the heroes in the story were told what to do, and simply did it. Later, in the "Odyssey," critical thinking is apparent in the story, with [Odysseus](https://history.howstuffworks.com/history-vs-myth/odysseus.htm) and other characters reflecting on their actions and the consequences of doing them."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm59tp7dm678mfmnfk04pyf)
* "Jaynes feels that this accounts for the rise of [organized religions](https://money.howstuffworks.com/money-and-religion.htm): Humans felt the need for righteous interpreters to speak to and for the gods, since we could no longer do it ourselves."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm59tr6yn71xv8df0a3meyn)
* "When the left side of the brain talks to the right side, it presents information as an auditory hallucination, making us *think* we hear a little voice telling us what to do."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm59ttpxsrt6780x3chwshr)
* "this idea is [also ethnocentric](https://books.google.com/books?id=F43vCgAAQBAJ\&pg=PA88\&lpg=PA88\&dq=julian+jaynes+ethnocentric\&source=bl\&ots=5YJXHmdT4t\&sig=lqPWyULALKjaePMNzRRld6nsHOo\&hl=en\&sa=X\&ved=0ahUKEwjwk---o-LXAhVB6CYKHYTfDDgQ6AEIUjAH), based entirely on the formation of the English language."

* "how does [schizophrenia](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/schizophrenia.htm) fit into this theory?"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm59tz62pswg5s2b567cpty)
