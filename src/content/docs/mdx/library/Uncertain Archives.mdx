* "the emergence of datafication—and its embeddedness in regimes of neoliberal global governance and increasing precarity—means that uncertainty and risk have become functions of disruption complicit with power."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmytmq5ajy6snmrszy9d2c78)

* "Uncertainty, then, exists at the crux of today’s governance dilemma between security and freedom: if modernity’s governance systems had demanded scientific predictability, universality, and rationality, today’s globalised economies also celebrate uncertainies (O’Malley 2009)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmytp5hc7f0q61nydr77a3tf)

* "data companies and governments across the globe welcome big data as an effective solution to deal with informational uncertainty, risks, and unknowns. Its promise of accurate calculations, precise predictions, and pre-emptions speaks to contemporary concerns about the taming of social, economic, financial, environmental, and political risks."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmytqdpm6b4ygqw2sn9y1x8h)

* "The surrealists were concerned with the high degree of structure found in unconscious objects such as dreams and subconscious actions, as well as with the impossibility of capturing and showing it fully. For them, archival practices were devoted not so much to imposing order on contingencies, but rather to how to work with the existing order of the unconscious (Spieker 2008)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmytvpyw71ff8kxbsdmdd5bx)

* "Thinking about unknowns invariably leads on to thinking about maps. We suggest that mapping is a fundamental archival–technological function and indeed is a drive to make unknowns known and render them available for detection and domination."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmytx3prcarwhv1ymw7xxerh)

* "depiction of uncertain and speculative territories by ancient Roman and medieval cartographers, occasionally with the phrases *hic sunt leones* (here be lions) or *hic sunt dracones* (here be dragons). Rather than leaving unknown territories blank, these cartographers populated them with fantastical creatures that would instil in the map’s readers both a fear of the unknown and a desire to colonise it."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmytxkxwqxp3b2z268yqh6ce)

[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvjy1ftg3vqyh8enxr1haq)

* "algorithmic mappings chart not only spaces but also temporalities (Parisi 2013). They create new archival folds in time: the future is folded back into the past, insofar as the future that an algorithmic system can predict is limited by the historical data used to train that system"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvkfftqtmj2xac21gc7qw0)

* "the conquest of unknowns is a highly generative and speculative act that gives rise to spatial and temporal imaginaries and a wide variety of coping and exploitation strategies (Kwan 2002). These imaginaries function as mirrors of our societies: they tell us something about how to cope with unknowns and about our affective relationship with the unknown."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvm4f5fx8sr6qvm3yky6f0)

* "Mimi Onuoha (2016) points directly at the unknown in her project *The Library of Missing Data Sets*, a list of data that go uncollected because of lack of political will, discrimination, or systemic neglect. The list includes topics such as “unarmed civilians killed by police” and “unpaid internships.”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvmh2x8cnqj48822wkcs6a)

* "In mid-twentieth-century metaphorical terms, the black box is the paramount symbol of that about which we can only know the input and the output. It has come to represent what we do not—or cannot—know. The black box expresses not only the unknown and unknowable, but also the human desire to know more, to make the opaque at least predictable, if not transparent. It is a question of how we cope with the invisible—with that which has a presence, yet which is not present or comprehensible with the tools at our disposal (Steiner and Veel 2018)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvn6dr3wspy883h4gx8cf8)

* "new archival mapping mechanisms embedded in big data have not only created new forms of knowing and predictability, they have also given rise to new modes of unknowing (Rosenberg 2014; Murakami Wood 2015)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvp5ppy7zd76ptjkkjmv7m)

* "significant challenge in the use of big data: namely, that the empirical past, no matter how comprehensively collected, can never preclude the arrival—or attack—of the unknown and the unexpected."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvpwnz5r0a6tp03bfydxqh)

* "the emergence of epistemophilia—and thus the seeds of intellectual life—in the child’s phantasies of getting inside the mother to explore and, as often, take over (as it were, to search and destroy) (Klein 1931; see also Spillius et al. 2011). As Toril Moi (1989) notes, epistemophilia is self-defeating, always frustrated by the limitations of the body. The Freudian drive for knowledge is structurally incapable of achieving total insight or perfect mastery."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvr1k1z3mnjgyyady341ra)

* "Often what can be known is presented as rational, while what cannot be known is characterised as emotional/subjective/irrational and associated with female subjectivity."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvs6p9g7m80ftjb07mgg1n)

* "big data archives increasingly record and sort such embodiments for the purposes of surveillance and profit."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvw5pjv8vn800c80msjpdq)

* "A new human right has even given a juridical name to this uncertainty: “the right to be forgotten,” which suggests that not all memory is desirable, and that it also matters in what context a memory is presented and into whose hands it falls (Sutherland 2017b)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvwrbr5wbj6en3r8166cxz)

* "as even state archives are faced with new working practices in the digital realm, there is a need to problematise and reframe the stakes of archival memory and its unknowns"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvxm1rse5pk3zxx3j70q5z)

* "When do we wish to be remembered, by whom, and in what contexts? Who decides the terms of remembrance? What are the tensions between the permanence of the digital sphere and the right to be forgotten (Sutherland 2017b; Caplan-Bricker 2018)?"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvxrw6k9xycg5r8gcc3pww)

* "The central issues that emerge through the perspective of error are the processes for detecting the lacunae, slippages, or resistant material that haunt archival holdings, as well as potential errors in archival functioning in the form of technical malfunctions, information anomalies, and human wrongdoing."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvz4txcjwj6xxgxwxrh6h9)

* "Wendy Hui Kyong Chun notes. Chun suggests that network analytics can be read as “the bastard child of psychoanalysis,” (2018: 69) in the sense that relationships and meanings are constantly being constructed out of seemingly disparate activities carried out by surveilled subjects."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyvznb43y5dt60yg6vx7492)

* "psychoanalysis, far from being an outdated mode of thinking in the digital age, can prompt scholars to think anew about big data and their analytics. We therefore welcome Chun’s proposal to maintain the presence of psychoanalysis in the study of contemporary archives, echoing previous works outlining the relations between archival logics and psychoanalytic perspectives (Spieker 2007)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyw0ewndf00rsgtt0vfa1z5)

* "We propose thinking about errors in the contemporary archive not only in terms of the technical problems they can suffer, but also giving consideration to the psychopathological states of mind that digital archives might reflect or even display as cognitive agents themselves."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyw0txtyea7ks6ygcb88kps)

* "The silent workings of today’s big data archives—constantly analysing and diagnosing data in order to detect new connections, trace new patterns, and generate new insights in the form of computational outputs—make Freud’s hermeneutic method of “evenly suspended attention” especially pertinent for a psychoanalytic reading of big data analytics."

* "At first glance, big data appear to offer a mechanical corrective, a concrete and technical method to analyse, detect, eliminate, and neutralise human error. As such, big data discourses on error belong to a long tradition of error studies as an applied science practised in a wide variety of fields, ranging from psychology and economics to engineering and business analytics, which address error as a practical question of detecting and preventing (or exploiting) unwanted occurrences."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyw4y9q6td6eeykrfe52v3z)

* "how can we conceptualise the epistemological and political implications embedded in these types of error regime, where uncertainty thrives on various scales? The problem at stake is what constitutes an error in the context of big data archives. What does the mode of detecting them entail? Which errors are tolerated in big data archives and which are feared? Which subjects are deemed errors by these archives?"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyw5md1tvc619541h3wnx4g)

* "Archival errors can give rise to fabulations, including quasi-life forms such as glitches and viruses. But the ends to which such errors are employed depend upon how the errors are inscribed in various strategic programmes,"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyw69z35gbthee2vqy63knz)

* "the sensory mode in which error is a signal, the disruption of a flow, and a bodily experience all at once. As such, we may simultaneously desire and fear it."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyw7vjsgqwgqc4zkt6q7try)

* "The difficulty of locating the political implications of error reflects how difficult it is to separate error detection from the political knowledge regimes of which those errors, whether productive or troubling, are a part."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyw8afh5x1czcdx05zb2zqz)

* "Sarah T. Roberts’s (2018) work on content moderation, which highlights the ideological framework of naming something an error as it plays out between humans, machines, and political regimes. As a form of uncertainty, error is thus simultaneously a spatial, structural, temporal, and political problematic."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyw8p4jh00v5xtn5mdn13p8)

* "error is a key concept for understanding today’s data landscapes"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyw8zcaset23rf7b82vqh7m)

* "We regard what counts as an error in big data as an unresolved and complex question that pertains as much to the interdisciplinary realm of big data as to the conceptual landscape of error itself. In this way we think of errors in terms not only of technical problems but also of political conditioning and psychopathological states of mind that produce their own logics, which in turn have their own aesthetics and modes of resistance."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyw9gxrnq0ywqc47rvvn14b)

* "etymology, the term *error* incorporates the mobile notion of erring, producing an understanding of error as a deviation from a route, a departure from a principle."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmyw9zbw6gc7edzm5drnwxp1)

* "St. Augustine linked the question of erring to the question of sin and morality, imagining God’s path as orderly and straight, and any deviation from it as sin"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmywadzcxn21hsvhdkgk6gs4)
