## Notes

* more thoughts on puppetry of performance, as he talks on portraying the three-dimensionality of what he wants to discuss by articulating everything that is beyond the lyrics with his muscles
* Body and facial expression taking on the extra weight so as not to bore with unconfident voice
* 'finding other people within themselves' 'dressing in thoughts from the sky'
* how he talks about playing characters and characters playing him, finding facets of himself in characters, is very reminiscent of what dnd has been like for me
* In creation and confusion and facets of self, 'god's a young man too', Ziggy as an experiment that outgrew itself
* 'kids killed the man' Ziggy and Hendrix 'kids giving him drugs' and a song explicitly about rock and roll suicides 'a psychosomatic death wish; I think that's because I was so deep in ziggy'
* primary and secondary source in music docs and how similar can be done with footage in other subjects and how this is done in video essay formats often
