### Part 1: Cultural Values in the Machine

* dearth of research on intersectionality + technology
* need to approach techno-cultural beliefs from a structural perspective
* tech's effects on perceptions of intellect, sociability, progress, culture, as mediated by tech
* within real-world cultural interactions rather than a future socio-political reality
* ICTs create social worlds that retain ideologies born of physical, temporal and social beliefs
* past cyberculture researchers worked hard to convince us otherwise (uncharitable framing but i see your point)
* hashtag ethnography
* white feminism online
* conditional visibility of Asian Americans
* online gossip of Black bloggers as 'discourse of resistance'
* peer-to-peer networked TV for marginalised voices, YouTube
* racially underrepresented populations in Facebook Groups
* video game tropes in the context of racial violence and police brutality

### Part 2: Cultural Values as the Machine

* addresses the materiality of the digital, the politics embedded in systems
* how cultural values are articulated through technology design in hardware and software
* don't want to highlight technological determinist perspectives on society and culture
* tech can be understood as an amalgam of an artifact, the associated practises, and the beliefs of its users
* focused on the design of software and platforms
* examines politics, infrastructure and labour that supports them
* commercial content moderators, politics of acceptability
* intersectional political economic critique of online dating systems
* national censorship, Turkish state and Facebook/Twitter, political neutrality (nope) of social media companies
* Latina in STEM, invisible information labourers - [hidden labour](/mdx/earth/hidden-labour)
* personification of virtual agents
* Internet as material infrastructure - [the internet as physical infrastructure](/mdx/earth/the-internet-as-physical-infrastructure), media production and power
* media codes and dominant ideologies in social media
