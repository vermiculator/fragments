summary: A literature review summarizes current knowledge on a research topic
  and helps develop a strong thesis. It involves a systematic process of
  selecting a topic, gathering information, and critiquing the literature to
  draw conclusions. Planning and careful execution are essential for producing a
  quality literature review that contributes to your field of study.

* the largest internally limiting factor is that i know which areas I'll struggle with and be drawn towards and that I'll abandon research directions that take me down paths I'm unmotivated to follow even if they may be fruitful or useful to others.
