* [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](/mdx/library/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism) book
* 'our personal and private experiences have been hijacked by silicon valley and used as the raw material for extremely profitable digital products'
* 'operations engineered as undetectable, indecipherable, cloaked in rhetoric that aims to misdirect, obfuscate, and just downright bamboozle'
* [data robbery](/mdx/earth/data-robbery)
* we think the only data they have is what they've given - in fact what we control and provide is the least important part
* residual data like typos and customisations and driving speed
* [data exhaust](/mdx/earth/data-exhaust) - waste materials harboured this rich predictive data
* some may indeed 'improve service' to you, but more is used for large training models and how people behave over time
* 'what i call behavioural surplus - these data streams filled with these rich predictive data'
* always more data collected than is needed
* not only affecting online targeted ads - its a layer under that - eg pregnancy ads fed to us before we know ourselves, due to buying patterns of other healthcare products
* predictive signals beyond just the face - eg can analyse the muscles, train models for facial recognition that may be used very unethically
* eg Uighurs in China monitored panopticon-style

• What are the specific ways in which design choices (e.g., user interfaces, data consent forms, personalisation features) facilitate or hinder surveillance practices?
