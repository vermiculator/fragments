## Notes

### Chapter 1

* "The modern city has been layered haphazardly on top of the old"
* "Their only remaining capitalist function is to hoist large blinking billboards on their tar-coated roofs."
* "the layering of decades"
* "post-industrial limbo"
* "urban performance art"
* "the transformation of the garment workers' struggle into sweatshop kitsch"
* "it is an attempt to capture an anti-corporate attitude I see emerging among young activists. This book is hinged on a simple hypothesis that as more people discover the brand name secrets of the global logo web, their outrage will fuel the next big political movement, a vast wave of opposition squarely targeting transnational corporations" but based on observation of underground networks rather than just prediction
* students growing more concerned by involvement of corporations in private schools
* washroom ads
* "academic studies were starting to look more and more like market research"
* "institutional priority shifted to those most conducive to private partnership"
* growing more concerned with daw away hidden projects and investments of their institutions
*
