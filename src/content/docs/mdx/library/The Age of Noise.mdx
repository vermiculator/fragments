title: The Age of Noise

* noise is both the presence and absence of information
* we are surrounded by extra noise, hums of traffic and electricity
* noise to drown out noise - noise cancelling headphones through active noise - this is hypermediation
* oversaturated with data, much data is noise
* noise is the 'success' state of the information age
* information was once scarce and is now too prevalent
* information age started with the transistor - directing and controlling voltage according to various inputs
* punch holes remediated to electrical on off remediated into binary remediated into assembly code and every code since and then GUIs
* the more we feed the machine, the more decisions the machine can make
* but decision-making is power.
* decisions encroach on our own, we no longer have to make them
* it may seem as though mathematically, scientifically made decisions are more worthy but our entire societies function on irrationality as well as rationality, and science/maths aren't inherently neutral but embedded with societies' problems
* we always find ways to recreate dichotomy, good and evil, yes and no, swipe left and swipe right
* with barebones circuitry the computer is designed to 'reveal' information and noise is any 'disturbance' to the flow of energy through the wires
* the 'noise' of the information age eg tv and phone static is generally cosmic background radiation
* radiation retained from the big bang -> omnipresent force -> godlike -> divine machinery, ghost in the machine, folklore
* generative AI essentially also works on an accept/reject signal
* every eg caption becomes information, when does the human consent for their expressions to be quantified in this way
* "The entirety of human visual culture has a new name. We used to call these collections archives, or museum holdings, or libraries. Today, we call them datasets."
* AI image generators are a super-combination, quantum superposition of the visual media offered (etc for nonvisual this is just more clear)
* but decisions are made on the curation without a human hand, without input source consent and with undue credit to the puppeteer
* these works in libraries etc are treated with care, require citation, there was some credence given to the wishes of the author - no 'do not mutilate' for AI source data
* our collective visual heritage in digital form is remixed with less care, without provenance
* personal works with personal contexts and relationships to their maker and necessary deliberate mediations are clumped together as a pot of humanity's work decontextualised
* [thoughts/ripped from context](/mdx/thoughts/ripped-from-context) as a violence
* use of the word 'diffusion' for AI is interesting - aspects of aesthetic and content and value diffused throughout the new pieces
* Server farms mined data with guiding principles of surveillance and financialisation
* the goal of social media has always been to have us sharing more
* generative AI is just another term for surveillance capitalism
* late stage capitalism looks like uncanny images of machines with no experience of the world, unsettling as they don't resemble what they represent, as automated surveillance never does
* AI is abstraction and prediction. (Often the wrong abstractions, and the moneymaking predictions)
* what survives history is what we choose to preserve through a series of institutionalised decisions
* archives more clearly show their gaps, and the gaps can be challenged. AI conglomerates into a soup.
* when humans are in the loop, humans can intervene in the loop
* a dangerous promise of a paradigm shift
* each combined image is actually degraded images
* AI navigates averages. Averages are not always useful
* the original context is irretrievable
* abandoned meanings - meanings occur from relationships
* echoes of colonialism - to reduce history to a singular flat ground from which to build
* nothing holds more weight than anything else - victims and perpetrators fused together
* a generated image is not new, it is wrong - the hypothesis of an image that might exist, but doesn't
* we are all fused together as one and sorted by the weight of the most common
* we can't study the geanologies of these images
* the idea of the remix is that we CHOOSE elements to rearrange, arrange them to the moment
* a haunting
* Mark Fisher sonic hauntology, music that references past visions of the future
* data is haunted by what it didn't include, even the census eg children not born because of who could not marry
* data contains only the trajectories of history that have been allowed to us
* feeding only past data means the ghosts become police
* the living are sorted by the dead
* we refer to datasets in AI rather than archives as archive proposes q greater degree of responsibility. Reliance on humans and curation and contextualisation
* datasets strip context
* archives group and sort by meaning but datasets only by quantified things
* the avant-garde as liminal space between archive and noise
* residue, telling the machine it doesn't know anything
* 'erotic footage', the machine leering, tracking and tracing a body as just as invasive when a machine does it
* following a bodies contours is incredibly intimate, why do we let machines do it
* but in being translated into media the image appears to enjoy itself. Literally submerging herself in the data
* there is such a thing as Art that involves AI, but art is not just what AI generates.
* creativity is in agency
* contorting the machines towards us
* fear with AI is more than we will fall into historic grooves with no concern for building a deliberate future
* Nam June Paik "I use technology in order to hate it properly"
* archives as collective memory
* the challenge of the age of noise is to find and preserve meaning
