* 'genealogy of remediation'
* 'our book's genealogy is one of historical affiliations or resonances, not of origins'
* the double logic of [immediacy](/mdx/earth/immediacy) and [hypermediacy](/mdx/earth/hypermediacy)
* characterising remediation as reform
* 'transfer of experience's in fact a remediated first-person film, 'subjective camera'
* virtual reality has the goal of unmediated visual experience but the physical infrastructure is hypermediation
* 'live' TV and POV TV
* period accuracy in historical drama as a seamless experience that is in fact painstakingly created and framed
* futurism as a design style and how it obsessively mixes styles and forms of media
* 'immediacy depends on hypermediacy'
* VFX and the compositing passes and complex technical requirements underneath
* in efforts to provide the most up to date info in the most completeness, there's a whole infrastructure of sensing and processing and displaying
* whenever one media has convinced you of immediacy the others try to appropriate it, eg web news and video news and TV news all copying each other
* simulation games, stretching further from tangible experience through the layers of mediation
* art also often denies the presence of the medium
* perspective and lighting tricks used in traditional and digital art in similar ways, and also now in 3D digital environments and VR
* dual icon/graphic and text function can be seen in analogue and digital mediums -- dual role that integrated two forms of media
* references as the printed equivalent to hyperlinks
* (are then 'peek'/previews of links a further level of this, combining the link and the content itself, as in some citation? And some link previews/icons combine visuals with the links as well as the text)
* computer graphics and the web presenting themselves as new and improved forms of other media
* digital media can be understood in the ways they honour, rival and revise linear-perspective painting, photography, film, television and print
* no medium does it's cultural work in isolation from other media or from socio-economic forces

***

* the promise of reform makes us more aware of the medium as a medium

* "our book's genealogy is one of historical affiliations or resonances, not of origins." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbpj98yg234kypkbmmfqsh8c))
