summary: People with autism often struggle to turn their thoughts into actions
  due to difficulties with a neurological function called "praxis," which
  affects their ability to execute movements smoothly. Research shows that they
  process movements step-by-step rather than as a sequence, making tasks like
  speaking or playing games challenging. Providing extra support, such as gentle
  physical cues, can help bridge the gap between intention and action for
  individuals with autism.

* "an aspect of neurology called “praxis,” or the ability to execute chains of smooth motor movements."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4w7xqy07djhqhdj816rpd55)
* "to break free from the gap between intention and action."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4w7xybtznmsdknm6jsrpymm)
* "Sequences of movements are controlled by “action-constrained neurons.”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4w7yj33vh4ppknth2aw6j8z)
* "activates neurons that control the “reach – grasp – bring to mouth” chain of movements, one of innumerable “action chains” stored in her brain’s parietal lobe."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4w7yzp25h26waycchqvcey5)
* "suggests that individuals with autism are not executing an action chain, but rather processing each movement sequentially. Under some conditions, it may become extremely difficult or impossible for someone with autism to intentionally control each individual step."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4w7zm78zbzvxhk1m2m17p1m)
* "Self-reports from individuals with autism mirror this kind of difficulty with chained movements, and the need to execute movements as single components"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4w800h5js66xmjs03chvnaa)
* "“When I was growing up, speaking was so frustrating. I could see the words in my brain, but then I realized that making my mouth move \[was needed to] get those letters to come alive; they died as soon as they were born."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4w811cvzjdvv0db95cg0b6t)
* "Previous work showed that when neurotypical individuals carry out a sequence of motor acts, the final goal of the sequence influences the characteristics of the first acts (such as speed or force)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4w8213hvjk4ct75m3k2rjtw)
* "to understand how differences in praxis affect communication and behavior, as well as how they may relate to differences in long-range brain connectivity."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4w83cbtkh7mgn6w3swqha1q)
* "“Praxis relies heavily on long-range communication between the frontal and parietal regions of the brain, and emerging research suggests that this connectivity is affected in autism."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4w83y2tvecqyax4qkz40dn4)
* "gentle physical cues, or “proprioceptive feedback,” can help individuals with autism complete motor movements."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4w846nj0k0c0qqaba1pcf6a)
