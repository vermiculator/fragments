title: A Space Program-Approach to High-Speed Rail
editUrl: false

summary: Last week, Canada's environment minister walked back comments about not
  funding new highways before I could even manage to send the comments to my
  friends in amazement. And while the US Secretary of Transportation has talked
  a big game about new transit and rail investments, there still isn't any rail
  being laid for a 300-kph rail line anywhere in the US.
