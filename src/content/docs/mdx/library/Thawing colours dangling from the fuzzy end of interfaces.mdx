summary: Thawing Colours is an interactive installation that uses melting ice,
  wool strings, and sound synthesis to engage the audience in playful

  through their interactions, creating a unique soundscape with every movement.
  The piece combines physical and digital elements, allowing for a rich
  experience that evolves over time.
