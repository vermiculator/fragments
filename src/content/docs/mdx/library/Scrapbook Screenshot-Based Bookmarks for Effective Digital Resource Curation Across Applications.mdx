[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21x70jzhezk2k7zg75hvw5y)

## paper version from 2022

* "often use multiple resources to do a single task \[2, 20]."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y3a98ka6ywybps451etmb)

* "conventional curation methods like bookmarks, recent document histories, and file systems place limitations on effective retrieval. Such features typically work only for resources of one type within one application, ignoring the interdependency between resources needed for a single task."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y1vd1rs5tm79jgjwspjgc)

* "no single method that works for all types of resources."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y49a2g6r05xt78pt2vh2y)

* "Scrapbook, a novel application for digital resource curation across applications that uses screenshot-based bookmarks. Scrapbook extracts and stores all the metadata (URL, file location, and application name) of windows visible in a captured screenshot to facilitate restoring them later."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y2bfb2g6596rr90we4njw)

* "multimodal—visual and textual—data helped them recall past computer activities and reconstruct working contexts efficiently."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y2p4s0f8jxb21r99z8pgn)

* "o manage and restore resources of multiple types in a disjointed process"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y4mb3ffzp2bawk9ampcp1)

* "identifying resources from largely text-based handles can be cognitively challenging. For example, a URL, a file name, or a web page title may not provide enough information for a user to recall the nature of the page’s contents. It takes workers extra effort to locate and label each resource carefully (e.g., by renaming bookmarks and files or organizing folder hierarchies) to facilitate later recognition and navigation."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y5rvbwwxfnh25x1w2wnrh)

* "difficult to bundle heterogeneous resources from different applications into a single bookmark"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y600hqzbc71ec7xatdxna)

* "leaving windows open to eliminate retrieval tasks is a common solution, but doing this results in a cluttered computing environment and makes it more challenging to locate necessary resources among many open windows \[24, 30]."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y6c1zzt33q12yt8a3dgnx)

* "screenshots are displayed in Masonry layout \[13] to roughly order them in a temporal order"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y73gjp0cbbc7zcrtyg591)

* "a title, screenshot, description, and date so that users can have multimodal cues for recognizing the digital resources contained."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y7k78gmmcw7hw9qbwtze0)

* "users can enter keywords in the search field at the top to find specific captures."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y7wbsvgavp4q9396teht5)

* "o curate cross-application resources."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y87q370f12hayt8a6wbzy)

* "Scrapbook offers a search feature that allows users to search their screenshots with metadata, which may contain information like application names and URLs."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y9c5tr99a8qnpjva9hqwk)

* "We use a dynamic bit-masking al- gorithm to identify all the visible windows in a screenshot, thereby also capturing windows behind the frontmost application."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y8pw37s3nnkcj4kkprpee)

* "The participants also found the Collection View helpful as a glanceable to-do list that helps remind them of their tasks."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y9tg1r1wgyaj5yr5mggwe)

* "s can later browse their collection of screenshots just as they might browse a photo album. A"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21y8y4pt4wynyrpcz9rtj29)

* "Some researchers distributed the effort needed to curate resources by inserting microtasks when users are interrupted \[43]. Inserting such microtasks was helpful for task resumption as well \[49]."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21ydc01eqhs3y699mceaf16)

* "micro-productivity \[7, 28, 38]"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yfve3hz38mm8842ev073g)

* "cross-device work support, assisting users in quickly switching between tasks and curating resources on the go."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yfdqb0zse95mvgxr03ch6)

* "Given the inevitability of interruptions and frequent changes in working con- texts, workers may encounter many resources of various types that they wish to curate, but curation activities—storing files, bookmarking web pages, opening files, and locating a web page—can degrade their working productivity."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yazcb9enmpyfgcf0rzyn6)

* ", researchers have found that as a user’s number of bookmarks increases, browsing, locating, and retriev- ing web pages becomes more challenging, ultimately requiring organizational efforts comparable to those applied to file systems: users must establish a hierarchical structure of bookmark folders, name bookmarks carefully, and categorize them immediately upon creation \[1]. Cockburn et al. found that web users maintain large collections of bookmarks, nearly 200 on average, thereby yielding a lengthy list of bookmarks with folders \[10]. The authors found empirical evidence demonstrating that users do not carefully curate bookmarks: imbalances between deletion and addition lead to the appearance of duplicate and invalid bookmarks. The limitations of native implementations of bookmarking may account for the popularity of commercial apps like Pocket 1 and Pinterest 2, which enable social bookmarking and provide multimodal cues (images and text) to facilitate web content curation. Similarly, collaborative web browsing and bookmarking was shown to be an effective cu- ration method for a specific task \[27]."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yhsgknnm9s16c8jy3e55s)

* "t information scraps in personal information management systems should be easy to capture and discover \[4]."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21ybq3wegjek117gdp57pt0)

* "Digital curation activities can range from basic, low-level tasks like saving a file to complex, high-level tasks like creating and maintaining an organized hierarchy of nested folders."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21ybydjj410sdcmsnyzp0mj)

* "humans could correctly identify images of their own among those of others with over 80% accuracy"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yjfxbvxgf27qvswdcxj11)

* ". Scalable Fabric organizes thumbnail-like windows into groups near the edges of a computer’s screen for workers to quickly switch between windows by clicking a thumbnail of the window \[45]."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21ycdet3q8f2kf0p0av08vb)

* ", visual information can be processed in parallel, meaning that a human can recognize an image at a glance; conversely, humans cannot recognize a block of text visually and must parse it for meaning \[47]."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yk6y8bz0xxfqn34tq8q4h)

* "Modern smartphone users take advantage of the ubiquity of smartphone cameras with the practice of taking photos to serve as external memory devices; for instance, a user might take a photo of a pillar to recall their car’s location in an airport parking lot or take a screenshot of mobile phone to save a QR code of a flight ticket \[16]."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21ym62jsbf1rfctcrexm65h)

* "Taskposé arranges thumbnails of windows based on their relevance to an ongoing task, helping users to manage multiple windows based on usage patterns and transitions between them \[5]."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21ymgxm78qc47a7qc2n3d5p)

* "WindowScape, which allows users to capture a group of windows on a screenshot to switch between digital work spaces \[42]. However, these systems only allow transitions between already open windows; consequently, they do not address the challenge of long-term resource curation and retrieval"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yn2wy2dhtxw3b4mj2epfp)

* "t the resource management features web browsers provide—namely, bookmarks and a browsing history—are not the most frequently used methods for revisiting websites. For regularly visited websites, users tend to simply type their URLs in the address bar; for irregularly visited sites, users repeat keyword searches to find the sites again"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yvemam3edmrzrv4rdkf0c)

* "Rule et al. investigated the benefits of using a visual history for mental reconstruction and arrived at design implications by exploring various design options (animation vs. still image, thumbnail size) and their effects \[32, 33]. ScreenTrack generates a time-lapse video by capturing screenshots periodically"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yqe6g3xw92nxxxnfj2dbf)

* but auto-methods over-save and feel invasive

* "they differ from Scrapbook in as much as they visualize screenshots in the temporal dimension rather than using them for explicit curation"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21ysdy13n67bjzerxykcnaa)

* "This result is consistent with a previous work which found that history and bookmarking mechanisms provided by browsers can be ineffective \[1, 48]."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21ywpv02r9m3kc2mkztx92k)

* "d bookmarks are “cumbersome to keep organized (P52).” Participants complained about having to give bookmarks recognizable names and place them in the right folders."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yx3nrh8gv75y18m8rkrye)

* "\[P20] "I name files something that makes sense at the time while I’m in a rush, but then have trouble recalling where I put it or what that name means.""  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yzqxyt17jdmggr17vbbjv)

* "Many participants (58/125) reported that the need to track where they left off when they resume a task is their biggest concern—to reconstruct their mental context. Thus, knowing the context of what needs to be retrieved is the biggest challenge."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21z0e10tmv0mjwkd4je2a9h)

* "f locating a desired bookmark within a large field of irrelevant ones"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yxhh6wak1kfp7hqaxvhck)

* "they simply had too many bookmarks (20/125), and sometimes, they even forgot about what pages they had bookmarked (18/125)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yy1145hnksjspeyjnd744)

* "bookmarks are not scalable"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yy9r658xkabajttvza7yt)

* "many participants (56/125) responded that they often leave windows open. In general, leaving too many applications open can impact a computer’s performance and create visual clutter,"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21z2q3rzcx8rhamp7cbm4my)

* "Users get lost in folder hierarchies."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yyevxt9vz72s9vntb4vh3)

* "most commonly use their operating system’s native file manager (e.g., Finder, Windows Explorer) to curate files; 70 out of 125 chose Often or Always. Arranging files on the desktop was also identified as a common approach (Often/Always: 58 out of 125) to saving frequently accessed documents and files."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21yz3cyzqtmezz7w85hqwvx)

* "we consider various actions inherent to curating digital resources— recording, browsing, searching, and retrieving—and we explain the design of Scrapbook as it relates to these actions."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21z3t54cxt6sej76j59ntq0)

* "Scrapbook extracts all available metadata from each window visible in a screenshot."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21zdbjp0c6he7d7ta6prm66)

* but is it relevant metadata? is 'as much as possible' the right approach? maybe for speed ig

* "metadata, such as file names, URLs, file paths, and application paths, is essential in reopening applications. We use an operating-system-level accessibility API to extract metadata. Combined with a screenshot, this metadata practically eliminates the challenge of locating resources immediately after recalling them from an image, which was one of three challenges we found in the formative study."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21zf28nw6t3dp0ja8h9ya7m)

* but that requires a lot of trust/permissions given to the app

* "it does not explicitly determine what portion of any window is visible."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21zhpv5qgj7g5eagq5fm45f)

* "Capturing all open applications is another option, but this may force a user to remove/deselect irrelevant windows when users retrieve resources from a screenshot. Therefore, we identify the visibility of each window by running a bit-masking algorithm"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21zm00sj7dfxjy0vysaarq6)

* "Scrapbook provides two screenshot capture options: capturing a screenshot by selecting an area (the first button in Figure 3) and taking a full-screen screenshot (the second button in Figure 3). The former is intended for use in targeting a specific application or a specific region ofa screen (e.g., a figure in an academic paper). These options resemble the capture options available in an operating system’s native screenshot functionality."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21zcs5hzv9aqxmy7zvbj195)

* "dynamically maintain a matrix, denoted by A in Algorithm 1, that represents an area of interest considering the occlusion between windows."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k21zm7wn9x80s7082szk2kyn)

[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2207kfz0m0qvr0vy0ng1r9t)

* "organization methods, such as filtering by time and type, searching, tags, and sorting, will be crucial in practice; manual curation (such as creating a folder hierarchy) should be avoided, as it is not scalable. Additionally, extracting semantic information from a screenshot and its metadata to automatically suggest a se- mantically meaningful title would minimize the effort expended on user-supplied information"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k220c5q415f126dxttqqvxay)
