## Notes

* Evidence of the capitalist waste discussed here is displayed well in [Bullshit Jobs](/mdx/library/bullshit-jobs)
* On writing off debt as solution to debt crises, pg39 "if the company fails to produce as expected \[...] the capitalists' /dreams of their ostensible worth/ are indeed lost" and that worth is indeed only a dream, 'potential worth' means there can be no loss, there was nothing there to lose-- "In a pro-worker and environmentalist framing of these losses, /the effort of workers and Earth's materials and energy have been wasted under capitalist management/."
* capitalism needs growth, growth needs exploitation and inequality
* Disney's Pocahontas - "You think you own whatever land you land on / The earth is not a dead thing you can claim."

## Extracts

* "Capitalism has no operating processes to either stabilise or reduce production: the compulsion to reproduce beyond itself is a systemic necessity. Thus, the key barrier to necessary change is that market-based economies not only will not, but actually cannot, allow production to wax and wane according to people's and earth's needs." <span class="sl-obs-tag">#resources</span> <span class="sl-obs-tag">#hyper-growth</span> <span class="sl-obs-tag">#sustainability</span> <span class="sl-obs-tag">#ecology</span>

* Marx- "Even an entire society, a nation, or all simultaneously existing societies taken together, are not the owners of the earth.

* Marx- "Man lives on nature - means that nature is his body, with which he must remain in continuous interchange if he is not to die.

* Money represents demand and supply, labour time and energy expended, it is all equal exchange - NO, money literally represents itself, and therefore nothing "Money offers no promise or potential as a rational form of calculating the benefits and disadvantages of producing on the basis of communal and ecological needs"plus chapter 3 alternatives, "Even if labour time involved in production or was the basis of price, and the primary influence on the value of money - or we contrived it to be so - this would not assist in either achieving ecological sustainability or a socially just system of production or distribution." on labour value -page 37
* "I hold that labour is the socio-political substance and essense of the mass of exchange value, including surplus value, within capitalism in a profoundly similar way to Marx's philosophy, but without recourse to the notion of equal exchange. I neither think that 'equal exchange' is usefully retorted in Marx's theory nor, and this is the most significant point, is equal exchange a useful concept for creating an appropriate post-capitalist society. Monetary efficiencies are not efficiencies oriented around the interests of workers or ecosystems."
* "Market rationalisation is less persuasive once we frame discourses to ask: 'Whose efficiency?' 'Whose logic?' "In this monetary world, not only is there no driver but also no driver's seat. The closest we have to a decision maker is the abstraction of money, which usurps potential participatory democracy whereby we might collectively preside over what we produce, where and how we produce it, and for whom.'
