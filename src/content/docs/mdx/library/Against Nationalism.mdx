Extracts

* "The nation is a smokescreen, a fantasy which hides the struggle between classes which exists within and across them." ^5ebca1

* "For us, as revolutionaries, [meaningful action](/mdx/earth/how-to-make-change) is whatever increases the confidence, autonomy, initiative, participation, [solidarity](/mdx/earth/solidarity), egalitarian tendencies and self-activity of the masses, and whatever assists in their demystification. Sterile and harmful action is whatever reinforces the passivity of the masses, their [apathy](/mdx/earth/apathy), [cynicism](/mdx/earth/cynicism), differentiation through [hierarchy](/mdx/earth/hierarchical-domination), [alienation](/mdx/earth/alienation), reliance on others to do things for them, and the degree to which they can therefore be manipulated by others, even those acting on their behalf."

* 'the earth is not a dead thing you can claim'
