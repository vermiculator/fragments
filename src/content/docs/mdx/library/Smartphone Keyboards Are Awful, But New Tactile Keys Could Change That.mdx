* "The device uses electroosmotic pumps, which can move liquids through electrical fields instead of mechanical parts. These pumps are 1.5 millimeters thick and create pop-up buttons, measuring almost five millimeters in height with enough pressure and stiffness to give them a solid feel when tapped."
