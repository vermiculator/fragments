* "absurd tropes, such as “blank trapped in a blank’s body” cause confusion among even well-meaning cis folks, feed internalized transphobia among us trans people, and provide endless straw-man fodder for transphobic ‘radical feminists,’ entitled cisgender academics, and other bigots."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5ak2px4ew2144enr2w9y5)
* "if the child is intersex– the doctor makes a decision. Surgery is then generally performed on the unconsenting infant to render its body more socially acceptable."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5ak627prb9fr30d72xetp)
* "We know that there is a different way, a way of autonomy, self-creation, and self-definition, and that this is the way we must follow, because we can never be happy with the parameters that have been mandated for our behaviour and our bodies."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5ak8zdrn0h4ft6kae2h1w)
* "Being trans is not always about falling “in between” binary genders, and as often as not, it’s about being something too expansive for those ideas to have meaning at all."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5akc0dqvd1xt8abytgff3)
* "This co-opting of the language of self-identification is not only condescending, it completely missed the point."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5aken4jsqjzh6hqcvbaxa)
* "the concept of binary sex is based on the fallacious idea that multiple sex characteristics are immutable and must always go together, when in fact many of them can be changed, many erased, and many appear independently in different combinations."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5akgp7zrbq2sknw6g8qx7)
* "The fallacies of binding identity to bodies, which are fragile, changeable things, subject to injury, mutilation, maiming, decay and ultimate destruction, should by now be clear."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5akjqchxf2xhxfy76zjmt)
* "Sex is as much a social construct as gender, as much subject to self identification, and besides all that, quite easy to modify."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5aknwe0s2vr8ftfp6sy79)
* "This is why I question the value of phrases like “man in a woman’s body” or “male to female.” Who is to say we ever *were* the “opposite sex?” Personally I will never again describe myself as “born female.” I was born a trans *male* and my years of confusion were due to being forcefully and repeatedly told that I was something else. This body is not a woman’s. It is *mine*. Neither am I trapped in it."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5akqvf7v7cdvarh6xzmpb)
* "Cissexism is believing that it is “natural” to be cis, that being trans is aberrant. Cissexism is holding the genders of trans people to more intense scrutiny than the genders of cis people."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5aksv8dhrhrdbf1p50y64)
