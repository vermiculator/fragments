* "(Hay, 2016) described failure as a “**way of knowing**” and argued that embracing failure is about “finding one’s way through darkness and coming out \[…] armed with new knowledge”."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5a2rhpm5qqmcecb3hnwm4)
* "if I get it right, I don’t need to iterate. Hence, I would say, **as soon as you think you are right, you’ve killed your creativity**"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5a2tgnnswt0kdmk1bzes2)
* "Research showed that we consistently move through series of experiences shaped by culture and social situations, and that these experiences pile up “forming a sedimentation of culture within individuals”. (Tania Zittoun and Alex Gillespie, 2015)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5a2wabjkxdqcb0b8p8zf9)
* "Vulnerability is not about winning or losing. It’s having the courage to show up even when you can’t control the outcome."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5a2y4jz2wtbmzbqnbdyq8)
* "Being vulnerable means daring yourself to face yourself and your surroundings. I see this as the cornerstone of any creative process."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5a3155rryrwvy989542g5)
