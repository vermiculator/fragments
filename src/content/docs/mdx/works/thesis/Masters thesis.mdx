**Resistive fragment assemblages:** How do decentralised web technologies better enable collectivist para-archives?

[Rowan Lucas Smith](/mdx/plain/about), Creative Computing Institute, University of the Arts London

## Abstract

Anti-capitalist work in [liberating](/mdx/earth/liberating-the-internet) [everyday](/mdx/earth/the-everyday) information practise from the goals of [monopolising tech companies](/mdx/earth/big-tech) is spread thin across various industry concerns and [disciplinary hegemonies](/mdx/earth/interdisciplinarity). By centering collectivist ideals I appeal to the digital commons and decentralised web to enable particular practises of hyperconnected personal curation that have potential for collectivist resistance. Through analysis of public assemblages of fragmented experience on existing web platforms ([Pinterest](/mdx/works/thesis/meta-thesis/pinterest-analysis-details) and [Are.na](/mdx/works/thesis/meta-thesis/are)) I'll discuss the benefits that [decentralised](/mdx/earth/decentralised-web) models and the [semantic web](/mdx/earth/semantic-web) could have on extra-institutional knowledge-work. This thesis is also a meta-work of [self-exemplification](/mdx/earth/self-exemplification). As a living [provotype](/mdx/earth/provotypes), this thesis is presented as part of a personal website indexing [cues](/mdx/earth/index-of-potential) to my own [self-transcendence](/mdx/earth/self-transcendence) through collectivist pedagogy and experimental tech.
