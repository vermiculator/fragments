* how to write for specific audience but retain authentic voice?
* my language has always been a combo of the hyper vague and hyper precise, whatever most accurately and honestly communicates my thoughts

***

* I'm very conscious of writing style, in that I am viscerally against writing in any way other than how I think when I think in words, but my (as precise and accurate as the situation begs and/or my brain provides) autistic language, my many literary influences, new fears of 'sounding like a chatbot' and new requirements in academic form have together formed a style that is more or less unbudgeable. I can write and rewrite and edit but ultimately if the words are really my own they will be overly formal and abruptly personal. I will be long-winded and reflective where I'm not so sure and concise on topics I've long understood in both body and brain. Whilst I'm always willing to learn I'm increasingly hesitant to write in a form that suits any one dominant style as increasingly my words are all I have.
