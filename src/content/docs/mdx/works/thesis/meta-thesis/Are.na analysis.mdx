See the [main body of my thesis](/mdx/works/thesis/thesis-practise) for context and discussion of the most relevant themes, see below for the details of my analysis, or see '[future-building on Are.na](/mdx/works/thesis/meta-thesis/future-building-on-are)' for individual blocks.

***

sub-question:
\- how do boards of the same variety/under the same topics as the [Pinterest analysis](/mdx/works/thesis/meta-thesis/pinterest-analysis-details) a) compare b) contrast c) extend themes established on Pinterest?

***

* started with descriptive codes established by the [Pinterest analysis](/mdx/works/thesis/meta-thesis/pinterest-analysis-details)
* then went through again with extra observations from Are.na specifically that didn't come up in [Pinterest analysis](/mdx/works/thesis/meta-thesis/pinterest-analysis-details)
* refined the codes on combination

| rich linked data         | title, description, image and source all useful and correct format. even more useful than the Pinterest equivalents                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | image as data, hyperconnected                                                                          |
| org bookmark             | much more common usage as bookmark to external org, but image tends to be less useful than Pinterest (auto-screenshot rather than diagram)                                                                                                                                                                                                 | image as gateway                                                                                       |

| pdf library              | directly embedded pdfs with or without source. book cover provides image cover. occasionally pdfs are incomplete/preview only                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                        |

| elusive provenance       | common to see unsourced quotes/similar but source is more easily findable through metadata details of provenance, source in image or at end of content                                                                                                                                                                                     | citation needed                                                                                        |

| multi-block spread       | multiple quotes or screenshots or images from one source split across several blocks, whether related or not. flat ontology not always useful.                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                        |

| embed me please          | occasionally other specific kinds of entities are saved on Are.na as links, (you can't save w/o an image on Pinterest). it's possible these will be (or the user was hoping for) an upcoming embed. examples: podcasts, slides, events, interactive sites, maps                                                                            |                                                                                                        |
| multi-modal              | text authored directly by an Are.na user, directly embedded video or audio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                        |
| screenshot cruft         | cookie banners, ads, social buttons, large menus, donation banners etc take up the auto-screenshot space. these screenshots rarely useful, maybe to archival but not curation. - peripheral articles in screenshots maybe useful...                                                                                                        |                                                                                                        |
| hopeful futures          | a lot more common to have themes of futurist/hopeful/building                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | actionable utopias, actionable dystopias, connecting past, present and future                          |
| loosely threaded         | less threaded dialogues overall. still commonly includes Twitter threads, and these more often has provenance/exact date included in image or linked to thread itself. reposts common from Instagram                                                                                                                                       | screenshotting threads, Tumblr thread of gold, syndication or repost?                                  |
| action in community      | more action-focused, explicitly in community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | self-actualisation, self-transcendence, strategies or tactics?                                         |
| earnest exploration      | less memes/edits/humour/etc than Pinterest, but still common. tends towards deliberately educational/serious/from academic texts than cathartic/fun/sarcastic. both casual and formal tones but more reflexive and more esoteric                                                                                                           | image assemblage, memes as formatting, 'vagueposting' revolution, making sense/making unsense          |

## Some Discussion

#### rich, multi-modal linked data

Are.na's infrastructure echoes Tumblr's multi-modality [(Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021)](/mdx/library/tumblr-book). Text blocks precipitate additional patterns of use to Pinterest's, such as [excerpting](/mdx/excerpting) and journaling. Saving PDFs is of huge microcultural and infrastructural significance as Are.na also now functions as a searchable textual archive. Allowing capture of a raw url is another benefit of this [multi-modality](/mdx/earth/multi-modal). Both Are.na and Pinterest's bookmarks insist on an image cover, an uncommon pattern in bookmarking which [can be useful for refinding](/mdx/earth/refinding-is-quicker-from-images-than-text) [(Tyżlik-Carver, 2022)](/mdx/library/screenshot-situations), but in aggregate produces redundant visual clutter of auto-screenshots. I determined that Are.na's bookmarks covered common categories: organisations, articles, resources and temporal bookmarks. Resource bookmarks would've often been more useful as embedded lists of links but sometimes included web tools or unusual formats. Temporal bookmarks were those with associated dates and deadlines: bookmarks never intended to persist.

#### knowledge lineage and reflexive curation

Whilst Are.na stores only a single source link as Pinterest does, its culture encourages added provenance in the text body, title, descriptions or comments, to a greater degree than Pinterest. In text blocks, users often quote or take excerpts from longer articles, which act as **general inspiration** on Pinterest (CITE) but contain **reflexive commentary** on Are.na. Many channels are designed explicitly around a titular questions, as study guides or with **embedded navigational instructions**. Are.na's culture of connectivity and methods of capture encourage [citational justice](/mdx/earth/citational-justice).

## Some Meta

### Consent

* For each Are.na channel I analysed here I created a private channel with the author to invite them to participate.
* As channels are private, asynchronous, conceptually less intimate than private messaging and allow embedding both text and PDF, they're a good venue for this kind of research - they could in future be used to solicit further data. I see in particular that they could be useful for recruiting and engaging in research for some neurodivergent people who could now take their time and relate to prompts in multiple formats.
* Whilst I asked for anonymous use of [Pinterest boards](/mdx/works/thesis/meta-thesis/pinterest-analysis-details#consent) I gave the option for Are.na users to be directly quoted, linked, or their blocks embedded in this project's website. This is for multiple reasons:
  * Are.na users seemed more likely to respond due to the private-channel structure that would surface as they browsed their own channels
  * Are.na users are more likely to have **authored** blocks directly rather than saved them from elsewhere (as they often function as bookmarks or are directly written as text), that they deserve credit for
  * I suspected and found that Are.na users value the **connectivity** of the platform, often discuss **knowledge commons** and **research** in general, so they would be willing to support and be directly linked with research on/in/around the platform

### Minor notes

* generally more explicitly political and more explicitly solutions oriented/actionable, more mention of specific movements and orgs, more sources linked, more advanced topics eg post-money economies. more likely to be cross-issue and intersectional
* link rot takes more forms - broken links as on Pinterest, but also broken embeds or outdated frontpage screenshots, very slow-loading embeds, etc
* a lot of meta content and content directly related to the tech/politics crossover, meta-meta to my own work, also research methods discourse, more specifically higher-academia-adjacent than vaguely referencing pedagogy as on Pinterest
* both Pinterest boards and Are.na channels on these topics covered certain scholars more than others - commonly saw quotes from bell hooks, adrienne maree brown, Robin Wall Kimmerer, Ursula K. Le Guin
* more deliberately square facades as article 'covers', possibly better than an auto-screenshot in many cases, or can be unnecessary, or another format view on metadata
* direct YouTube embeds are on both Pinterest and Are.na, but more common on Are.na and often have extra commentary or direct quotes in the description on Are.na - room for reflexive engagement
* Are.na has more gifs, less posters and slogans, equal amount of diagrams/mind maps/word clouds and real-world graffiti/similar
* Are.na embeds sometimes do and sometimes don't provide backups - pdfs are on their server but not eg instagram posts or website links
* occasionally saw scanned-in book pages :)
