title: why study these platforms

* why Pinterest
  * visual priority, ease of use, common low bar and casual use can lead to more instrumental use, more layman's than arena often, and a lit of existing research on it
  * see [why multi-purpose information space matters](/mdx/earth/why-multi-purpose-information-space-matters)
* why Are.na
  \- 'a platform for saving visual bookmarks' ultimately
  * by these analogies Pinterest is a commonplace book and are.na is a scrapbook "Depending on what these books contained, they were either called commonplace books or scrapbooks. The former usually contained fragments of carefully selected texts (such as quotes, poems, or scientific tables), whereas the latter also contained material ephemera (such as locks of hair, pieces of ribbon or leftover ticket stubs)."

    * needs to move from Pinterest style to are.na style as unclear if Pinterest-style assemblages are actually made use of (find that source) but are.na directly embeds the eg further literature that is only saved as index on Pinterest - direct link from the idea to the action, allowing more instrumental use - so scrapbook over commonplace book, more multi-modal, more tangible (direct digital 'materiality' of screenshots but sourceable or even embedded-interactable) akin to having the actual item and its experiences embedded rather than a reminder of it or shadow of it
  * text input and more likely to create own content? - open community values
  * best multimodal and hyperconnective
    * [why multi-modal information space matters](/mdx/earth/why-multi-modal-information-space-matters)
  * reverse google search??
  * APIs, GraphQL
  * Reader mode?
  * why not work within/co-design with are.na community -- because my interests are wider. we all stem from many platforms. the fundamental building blocks of are.na still prioritise the centralised way. it is still built from a platforms perspective rather than perspective of ecosystems/interfaces/interoperability of existing filestores. much of what people bring into are.na either exists already in their file systems or another platform or is a link to elsewhere. the rest is free text that could go anywhere. it's the multi-filetype, 'connections' and interface that actually make it specialised.
