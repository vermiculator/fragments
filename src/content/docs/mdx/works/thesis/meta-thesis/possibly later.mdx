## direction [->](/mdx/works/thesis/meta-thesis/directions)

other important angles for me longer term - focus on multi-perspective **knowledge commons** (interoperable private/collaborative knowledge), curation of **instrumental** and **experiential** knowledge alongside past narratives, **multi-modal** content and **fragmented** knowledge, framed by **permacomputing** and **tangible** interfacing

## tool

* directly integrate with Are.na as another backend
* work adjacent to, with or on 'Gather', Solid as backend
* migration from Pinterest
* migration from file collections
* bookmarklets or browser extensions for saving
* Combine semantic 'image snippets' with the collage cutout style of Pinterest
* Obsidian plugin, translation to Obsidian's new 'base' filetype for structured databases amongst the loose scraps
* simple phone software that takes over screenshots or just provides vault access that you 'share to'
* auto archive to commons also eg archivebox, how does dokie.li implement this
* IFTTT / Zapier integrations, or similar
* integration with Readwise API to sync tags and library?
* syncing with other backup cloud storage providers
* wider accessibility/customisation
* block protocol compatibility?
* peer-to-peer backup mechanisms, consider NextGraph, CRDTs, AnySync
  * AnySync could allow fully encrypted peer to peer backup and better linking to other Objects
  * Solid Pod -> stored via API in AnyType format as Fragment Object??
  * open protocol Protobuf?
  * "Anytype encrypts and versions each block separately (with CRDTs). Markdown files can be encrypted, but not individual sections. So no auto-merging or field-level privacy." - [r/Anytype](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anytype/comments/1k4w1pw/comment/moea18u/)
* Speculative design of the **physical** content capture process
  * scanner/camera model
  * Point n shoot camera that runs its own server, eg rasbpi
  * physical media phone extension (pass through charge)

## theory

* spatial memory, potential of AR in memory work due to this
* forgetting. meaningful deletion
* better refinding
* more on digital commonplace books,
* knowledge graphs and linked data
* social dynamics of sharing
* voice notes, document scans, video clips, streams
* concepts/proposals of tangible portable dedicated capture device
* personal memory, albums and archival 
* embodied collective healing
* Research-through-making / Prototypes / Material Exploration
* more on physical scrapbooking / collage / art resistance / posters / zines
  * [more on physical scrapbooking](/mdx/more-on-physical-scrapbooking)
  * [on digital text and digital scrapbooks](/mdx/earth/on-digital-text-and-digital-scrapbooks)
* more on annotations and highlights
  * where are my prev notes
  * "Simon Rowberry (2016) argues that the use of the “Kindle highlights” feature of the Kindle e- reader, in which users can see others’ highlighted phrases while reading, is akin to a collective commonplacing"
* [digital memory](/mdx/digital-memory), [memory through web platforms](/mdx/memory-through-web-platforms), [digital decay](/mdx/digital-decay), memory as mediated through technology
  * older people 'save' by printing off, younger people 'save' by scanning in
  * (Annabell, 2023) "Scrolling back: Remediation within and through digital memory work"
  * (Smit, Jacobsen and Annabell, 2024) "The multiplicities of platformed remembering"
  * (Krueckeberg et al) "Memory loss: Youth and the fragility of personal digital remembering"

## data

* analyse commonalities in asks in the Are.na [Feedback and Feature Requests](https://www.are.na/are-na-team/feedback-and-feature-requests)
* I didn't include this primarily as this is primarily nit-picking rather than full infrastructural issues, as is the nature of incremental improvement, but this could still be really useful to see sticking points for current Are.na users
