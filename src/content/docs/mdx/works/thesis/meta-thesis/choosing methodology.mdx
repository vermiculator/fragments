* you are proposing the method, your insights can become methodologies
* combining methodologies and frameworks
* develop design principles from theory work and data
* with these methods the research will only address those who already have a public curation practise as it is analysing the affordances of the platforms to allow this - it excludes those who could benefit from this but haven't found/can't access/can't work the tools.
* how do i select case studies? the ones i selected so far are due to them having the right selection of things for what i'm thinking about
* this is more like deductive reasoning
* more [participatory methods](/mdx/earth/participatory-methods) fit well with my goals but I didn't have enough time to do it properly, how it should be done
* I'm perhaps interested in forming dialogues online as this is both easier for me and by extension likely easier for the kinds of people I'd have participating - but also raises access issues and sampling issues
* need to be reflective and transparent on choices of methods, but what if i don't know why i chose it or i chose it out of fear/inaccessibility? is it too revealing of my own anxieties to discuss this or is it essential to the work?
* my own bodily experience is crucial - i can't handle the texture of paper, so why should I be working with paper?
