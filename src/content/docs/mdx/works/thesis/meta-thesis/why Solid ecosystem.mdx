the needs for

* data ownership/portability/control/etc
* hyperconnectivity, linked data, semantic web

A: [RDF](/mdx/earth/rdf)

* how can we use RDF
  * in an established ecosystem
  * with common standards and interoperability
  * old web style / durable

A: [Solid](/mdx/earth/solid-rdf)

* but how do we do this
  * [Solid limitations](/mdx/solid-limitations)
  * [data format decisions](/mdx/works/thesis/meta-thesis/data-format-decisions)

why quads

* in need of a fourth element to the triple Statement
* to give details of context
  * such as perspective of data or author of changes, depending on how we decide to implement

selecting a Quad format
\- information sciences consider this problem when formatting their data in eg humanities
\- what are the options
\- humanities/archival fields often deal with 'complexity of uncertain or even contested knowledge' - [quickref#^f291c4](/mdx/quickref#block-f291c4)
\- this is just the sort of consideration we are dealing with here - trust, authorship, lineage

* why Conjectural Graphs?
  * are an extension of Named Graphs
    * why Named Graphs?
      * use quads
      * fully compliant with RDF and SPARQL standards.
      * support multiple serialization formats, such as TriG, TriX, and N-Quads
      * scalable
  * "Conjectural Graphs are particularly useful in domains like the Arts and Humanities, where repre­senting uncertain or evolving claims without asserting them as facts is essential."  - [quickref#^f291c4](/mdx/quickref#block-f291c4)

* so, are Conjectural Graphs compatible with the Community Solid Server?
