discuss through my own history:

* cataloguing/indexing
* excerpting

***

As a kid I used a lot of paper and read a lot of books. I grew up in a time and place transitioning from well-indexed physical encyclopaedias to well-indexed early Google, before SEO and AI-summary. I scoured for and wrote down information I found in the world, in books and online.

I always wanted to make things and I always wanted to know things, so this culminated largely in a mass of 'booklets', designed to be mostly informational and mildly entertaining.

I view this now as a curational practise, a mnemonic device and an act of expression. Mostly I wanted to share things I found interesting and believed to be truthful, through the most rigorous research an autistic child is capable of (that is to say, pretty rigorous). But I also wrote about things I wanted to be true, or ways I wanted the world to work.

Through schooling my exploration felt artificially split into 1-hour chunks. The physical matter of learning we kept at first in a named drawer, then in folders, then subject-specific books. Occasionally we'd keep a project-focused folder, which made a lot more sense to me. Subjects and exercise books divided knowledge and thought into arbitrary chunks kept chronological, not at all recomposable.

* commonplace books in youth
  * 'learning journals'
  * 'wet-play' books
  * school planner
  * words-at-the-end-of-the-day

* constantly frustrated by the impracticality of handouts

* kept separate they were lost and damaged

* started to copy out handouts into the main flow - the materiality of it was not helpful past first engagement, wanted the core text extracted

* when we had free reign come Sixth Form I kept binder per subject and wrote scrap notes

* I converted less-temporary notes into useable guides later - my first practise of 'fleeting notes' as discussed in the 'PKM' space

* [write for yourself by default](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXDPrYcxUSZbF5M8vM5Y1U9)

### from paper to digital

* developed a strong aversion to paper

* used whiteboard wherever possible - not portable
* that's where the stuff I wanted to capture was already - benefitting from past work/others work more readily
* fell out of good notetaking practise when studying computing - the info you need doesn't well fit a notebook - forever looking for a decent digital equivalent

## digital - switching

* privacy and portability of the very personal
* bulky apps, non-existent apps
* interfaces
* multi-type
* multi-source, share to
* de-googling, open-source
* equivalents wouldn't store images or had no easy/reliable backups
* enforced filesystems and hierarchies
* lock-in and limits
* always experimenting with new systems
* backups, robustness
* data portability
* pkm space, fleeting notes and zettlekastens

## scope

not mentioning - later consideration, as ensuring the security of very sensitive documents should be relatively trivial with the privacy-conscious granular mechanisms of a Solid Pod based system - i.e. other people have considered this angle in depth as another entire motivator for the systems already, password storing apps have their own encryption mechanisms, etc.

* personal private document storage eg medical, financial
* signing legal documents, confidential file sharing
* passwords and 'secure notes'

also not considering here as it is closely linked but adjacent work - special cases I'll expand on later

* photo memories, home videos, etc
* personal data such as contacts, media tracking, etc

## somewhat related things I've thought about

digital cultures

* Facebook -> Tumblr -> TikTok -> Tumblr
* as I developed socio-political understanding it was echoed in my experiences online
* self-actualisation through finding community online
* from fandom to queerness to neurodivergence to collectivism

extra information practise in the family home

* the little notes and lists my mum writes
* todos and planning still on paper or whiteboard
* mood boards, vision boards, poster walls, christmas list collages
