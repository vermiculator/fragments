### Notes

* preserve old methods and processes, what worked and what didn't and in what context
* to avoid [unneccessary redundancy](redundancy%201.md) that is [wasting human effort](/mdx/earth/wasting-human-effort)
* info should reside in multiple formats including physical in order to keep ideas around. historically society often destroys all its info and has to start again.
  * Resource printers directly from digital stores?
