* TODO
* there is some form of Faceless YouTube content in most genres now
* more and more vtubers on yt and twitch and crossing over into collab with non-vtubers
* tiktokers making AAC and TTS more normal
* more widespread captioning, auto-captioning, contextual captioning and captioning for emphasis
* 'low-fi vibes' content with minimal to no voiceover and/or no talk-to-camera
* all of this contributing to a more accessible environment for many more sorts of people to share online/take part in dialogue
* which feeds into further accessibility measures
* even for able-bodied people, widening ability for participation in the internet with less personal commitment eg than in vlog-heavy youtube era
*
