Academic research, scientific knowledge, institutional claims, constructed technologies and theories are not neutral expressions of an objective truth.

* neutrality / objectivity upholds dominant systems
* post60s began critiques from feminist, indigenous, postcolonial scholars on academic authority
* destabilising this force by expanding boundaries of the framework through public, activist and participatory forms
* specific disciplines of study emerging from this ([inside agents](/mdx/earth/inside-agents)/[be the change](/mdx/earth/be-the-change)) as well as external resistance ([can't put it out from inside the house](/mdx/earth/cant-put-it-out-from-inside-the-house)/[the masters tools](/mdx/earth/the-masters-tools)/[the revolution will not be televised](/mdx/earth/the-revolution-will-not-be-televised))
