* "“the human evolves through externalizing itself in tools, artifacts, language and technical memory banks” (Stiegler, 2010, p.65)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0rv4m5ry2he5t1rnt7f1m9e)
* "Every act of externalizing one’s thought and memory instigates a certain milieu characterized by power relations, which in return affect and shape the lives of those implicated in these milieux."
