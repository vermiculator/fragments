## Notes

* I've witnessed and been a part of a variety of digital communities but have no sociological framework to see how and why some work better than others
* There are increasingly now paid roles in digital community building, moderation, support, etc
* so there must be a developing 'best practice' etc
* Incredibly subjectively, neocities feels like how tumblr used to feel (in early to mid 2010s)
* I've seen people describe TikTok like early YouTube
* wikipedia, wikihow, open source
* open and closed discords, discord for tech
* streaming communities
* tiktok niches
