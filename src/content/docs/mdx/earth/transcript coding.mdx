* going from rich conversational human data into structured data for analysis
* line by line analysis, ask what is happening and what it represents
* create initial codes that are close to data, less analytical
* identify conditions, interactions, consequences, causal links
* develop subcategories and properties
* use in vivo coding alongside open coding for in depth understanding

***

* open coding: breaking down data into small parts and labelling them
* axial coding: connecting those labels/codes to find relationships and meaningful patterns
* selective coding: identifying your core concept by seeing how codes relate to one another and building your final theory around that central story

***

* First-Order (Descriptive or Nominal): [in vivo coding](/mdx/earth/in-vivo-coding)
* Second-Order (Interpretive/Data-Driven): use emerging theories for further data as you go
* Third-Order (Theory-Driven): use external theories or conceptual frameworks
