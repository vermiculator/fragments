(complex physical and/or social environments are often inaccessible to me - disability frames my perspective with more emphasis here)

***

* I'm referring here loosely to multiple things
* to the kind of everyday political engagement people come across in ordinary lives
* as well as direct actions/local politics/small impactful actions of more politically oriented people
* as well as integration of political values into daily life
* as well as physically the forms of public discourse and engagement in public space that there is a lot less of in the hyper-capitalist hyper-individualist Western world
* internet and social media as public forum and how to retranslate that into physicality
