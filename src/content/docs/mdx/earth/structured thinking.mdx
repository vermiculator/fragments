## Notes

* deliberate thinking patterns, thought exercises
* schemas
* systems thinking
* journalling, free-writing and self-reflection
* thought exercise as play, the art of discussion
* CBT is not a catch-all, CBT is a specific therapy for specific sorts of problems, CBT is often ineffective for autistic people
* how often are our thoughts structured and when do we 'freely' think, does this differ by profession and occupation, or other factors eg neuro arrangement, does this link to determinism vs free will
