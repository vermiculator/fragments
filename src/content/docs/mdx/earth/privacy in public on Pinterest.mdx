* Pinterest commonly viewed as private, users unaware they're posting publicly
* infrastructurally content-first approach
* the marketing to users that boards as uniquely yours whilst the technology functions for advertisers as a trend-machine and auto-market-categoriser means users often perform as if in private but for public consumption

## Mentions

* 'Collectors on Pinterest act in the privacy afforded by a noisy, public environment' - 'Wedding Dresses and Wanted Criminals: Pinterest.com as an Infrastructure for Repository Building'
* "on Pinterest, these two streams converge more seamlessly, thus blurring the line between personal and public."  - [(Lui, 2015)](#block-3f2c3a)
