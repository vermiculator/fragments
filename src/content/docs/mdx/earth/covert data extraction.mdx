## Mentions

* "the timeline structure encouraged users to post pictures from “the pre-Facebook days of their youth"
  * "From then on, all content uploaded on the timeline was, by default, set as public with optional privacy. Only a month after the timeline was introduced, Facebook began extensive collaboration with external companies, whose advertisements started cluttering users’ profiles."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ybay46x3myra1mx5myyx7y)
  * "While the timeline offered the user a chance to neatly organize his/her flow of data and decide on its openness and disclosure, it simultaneously established a more efficient infrastructure for covert data aggregation and storage."
