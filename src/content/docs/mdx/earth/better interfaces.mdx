## Notes

* interfaces driven by human need, hardware taking cultural-political stance, interface branch of tech-for good
* organic connections through soft-body tech
* consider combining epaper combined with efabric, and what it is that is useful about these new materialities, and looking into others
* fabric environmental sensing and computing
* E-textiles for assisted communication, extensible custom systems
* [interactive learning mediums](/interactive-learning-mediums) through physically embodied tech
  * early years educational resources that are digitally enhanced, safe (and durable?)
* interfaces developed through [participatory methods](/mdx/earth/participatory-methods)
* ux research to the extreme, from initial conception to continued testing and improvement
* consider eg indie tech with considerable consumer participation
