there was neuroimaging that suggested autistic people's brains don't prune neuron connections as regularly as non-autistic people, could explain the prevalence of strong pattern recognition, tendency to want to see a full picture in full context, ability to link anything back to a special interest, etc

need to find the source again
And see how they categorised autistic and non-autistic people
And see how this may apply in other neurodivergencies

but feels true to my experience and colloquially
but genera
