characterised by issues with thinking, concentration and memory

as an acute symptom of stress/intoxication/dehydration/sleep depravation/illness/injury/medication

or as a chronic symptom of neurodiverse conditions/long-term illnesses

as referred to in my own experience, as a long-term symptom of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, also known as ME (a sibling-condition of Fibromyalgia and Long Covid)

it is as a part of my mode of being that is for me by now largely inseparable from my [autistic](/mdx/earth/autism) experience post-puberty, as I've had it since my teens.
