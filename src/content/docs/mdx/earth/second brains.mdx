Either physical or digital catalogues of thoughts and insights by a single person

***

* Like [knowledge graphs](/mdx/earth/knowledge-graphs) by one single person
* How are connections possible from the strictly one-perspective (eg blogs) to the strictly multi-perspective (eg wikis)
* fleeting notes vs carefully constructed prose
* atomic notes, thematic links, taxonomy and categorisation
* external cognition, philosophical implications

## Mentions

* [memex](/mdx/earth/memex) - "an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory" -  Vannevar Bush, As We May Think
* "exocortex" - [Hamish MacDonald](https://kor.nz/projects/memex)
