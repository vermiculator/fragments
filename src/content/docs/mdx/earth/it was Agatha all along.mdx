pls explain the joke: From Marvel/Disney+ Wandavision (2021) ep 7 "Breaking the
  Fourth Wall", where a minor character was revealed as the driving force behind
  the scenes. A common media trope used with this specific example as the
  semi-serious semi-whimsical tone of the show fits the
  almost-laughable-atrocities of capitalism, colonialism, fascism, etc that I am
  referring to.
