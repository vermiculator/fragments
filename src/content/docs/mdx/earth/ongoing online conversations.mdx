mixed medium and platform
\- video responses
\- forum posts
\- Tumblr posts
\- comment threads
\- twitter/x/threads
\- TikTok stitches

### does it have to be public

* How some stuff people share is actually just for immediacy amongst friends, some is as expression

### does it have to be a dialogue

* some stuff people share is strictly functional bulletin type, some is expressive of specific viewpoints and perspectives historically for example, all of which are somewhat static
  * or final creative works in portfolio format?

### does it have to be private

* intellectual work
* public governance
* other things needing high transparency

### it needs to be continuous, could be either sync or async

* innovation
* creativity
* people connection
* collaboration
* yet two-way convo isn't how anything is set up properly for, eg everything is primary post secondary comment, prioritised new posts, and 'threads' deprioritised
