* on setting research questions you can set multiple progressive questions on a topic
  * eg show there is a bias, what is the bias, how can we address it (interventions? technologically? socially? policy?)
* you can propose new language, new practises, new methodologies as a result of your research
* at doctoral level you are claiming the knowledge and expertise, new original 'contribution'
* learning the process of doing something about it, not just abstract analysis - [symbiosis of theory and practise](/mdx/earth/symbiosis-of-theory-and-practise)
* [slow labour](/mdx/earth/slow-labour) of constructing and deconstructing your methodologies
* scope is important, research context for the problem
* if you have an answer its probably not the right research question
* 'participating' - are they setting the agenda/benefitting etc, beyond tokenistic
* question everything. is it an assumption? no unsubstantiated claims
* selecting and simplifying problem space to reduce complexity, scope and purpose, making tractable problems from intractable ones
* this is how i break down the space of what I'm interested in, and combine with others, multiple models and frameworks
* model of vs model for
* practise-led or practise-based
* practise-led uses practise along the way but the practise isn't the final contribution in the way it is in practise-based research
* history of the problem space
* how the problems are evolving in design and use
* understanding claims and assumptions and multiple scholars' and disciplines' perspectives
