## Mentions

* "This practice of professional sorting and cataloging is **explicitly meant for the larger community—curation for the public**. Museum and library collections may be privately owned, but are a part of the general [commons](/mdx/earth/public-property); they are resources for a collective." - [(Lui, 2015)](/mdx/library/public-curation-and-private-collection-the-production-of-knowledge-on-pinterest)
* "Curation therefore encompasses practices of sorting, classifying, and labeling for the purposes of organization and **display**"  - [(Lui, 2015)](/mdx/library/public-curation-and-private-collection-the-production-of-knowledge-on-pinterest)
* "If knowledge is understood to be the resource that these institutions provide then, as Hooper-Greenhill (1992) contends, the role of the curator is to **shape that knowledge for the general public**, through the creation of accessible object categories"  - any group curation needs to be interfaceable?? - [(Lui, 2015)](/mdx/library/public-curation-and-private-collection-the-production-of-knowledge-on-pinterest)
