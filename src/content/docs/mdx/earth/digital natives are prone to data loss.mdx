## Notes

* 'digital natives' without physical record of memories or important documents or important resources/guides are prone to losing entire lifestyles, entire histories, entire records.
  * central backups are a thing but are held by fallible institutions
  * huge losses at the whim of corporations and platforms
  * better personal backup mechanisms?
    * requires non-proprietary data formats
    * open-source clones of popular sites are useful for this
  * providing public decentralised data retrieval?
    * eg free/open-source data extractors
    * but also, a physical alternative?
      * eg streamlined mechanisms to store e-books on external storage, and/or print them off for archival
      * consider those photo printing booths in eg Boots where you can connect social media
      * this but free, private, public, open-source, etc
      * even could compromise bring-your-own-paper or similar
  * provision of information in a wider variety of formats can support those with accessibility needs, cross international/political limitations (e.g. communicating with dissident activists of authoritarian states), etc.
  * Open data is incredibly powerful.
* Corporations as non-individuals despite appearing so in law -- concerned ultimately with protecting their assets and capital, mostly non-inclusive of the workforce or service users -- yet hold a huge amount of knowledge-power, personal info, etc
* to the extent that younger generations have a lot more stake in the platforms they use that does not translate to power and autonomy
* Entire communities, lifestyles, careers, reputations etc at the whim of mostly oblivious companies
* platforms are designed to keep users on and not move their data out.
