"What also appears to be of crucial importance in the [para-archive](/mdx/earth/para-archival-practise) is the singular perspective and specific standpoint from which it is formed."  [(Smolicki, 2017)](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture#block-f59257)

"Unhinging God’s Eye"\
"...the device’s historical association with ideas of perfect, disembodied, objective vision. The camera obscura was believed to give the viewer “a vantage point onto the world analogous to the eye of God” (Crary, 1990, p.48)" [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yx8gjmgwffbc5msg5r3hq0) [(Smolicki, 2017)](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture) - [portability affords diverse singular usage](/mdx/portability-affords-diverse-singular-usage) - if this 'objective' third viewpoint is becoming part of all-seeing, portable/transferable knowledges make you part of an all-knowing - [emergent consciousness](/mdx/earth/emergent-consciousness) in these assemblages?
