free as in freedom and free as in beer.

## Mentions

* "I don’t share the same perspective as most '[fossbros](/mdx/earth/tech-bros)' and organizations like the FSF. Software freedom is important because it gives people agency instead of delegating control to an authority; it’s not valuable in and of itself, and promoting a 'fosssh' alternative that has vulnerabilities and [accessibility](/mdx/earth/accessibility) issues is sometimes counterproductive."
