* automated capture isn't recording as it doesn't intentionally 'extract it from a flow of events not worth capturing' or does so without attention to the full particulars of an individual situation - if you don't re-code the representation of a given moment, selected on particular criteria, or the technological context is determined without active choice, it is capturing rather than recording.
* even captures taken based on triggering a sensor, for example, requires the active choice to record something specific unless it is a device you didn't choose, default you didn't choose, etc. difference depends on agency and reflexivity
* recording internalizes and externalizes at the same time - the decision to do so internalises it and "by stabilizing it onto an external, material trace" externalizes it [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y32x7phsmcvzr6mwp3qpeg)
