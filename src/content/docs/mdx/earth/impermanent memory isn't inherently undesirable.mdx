* levels of archival quality mediums
* is it desirable to have digital memory fade at a human rate?
* is any rate we attempt to choose just arbitrary?
* desirability of remembering and forgetting are [contextual, relational and situational](/mdx/earth/contextual-relational-and-situational)
* where/should we ever enforce complete deletion and where is 'resurfacing' valuable?
