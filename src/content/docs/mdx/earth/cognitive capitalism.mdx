* Alternatives often not pursued as capitalism is so intrinsically linked with how people process thoughts and build solutions and consider the functioning of society that they cannot imagine a world without it

## Mentions

* "“entrepreneurial capitalism,” with a new coat of paint, is being trotted out as the “Progressive” alternative to this neoliberal model of capitalism. It’s the “**cognitive capitalism**” or “green capitalism” of Barack Obama" [->](/mdx/library/capitalism-comes-in-many-flavors)
