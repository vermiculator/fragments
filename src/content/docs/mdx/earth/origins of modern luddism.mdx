* on privacy-minded people spreading generalised tech-fear due to mixed messaging
* smart devices always listening, internet of things encroaching where it isn't needed or wanted
* public humiliation, from 'town square' to reality shows to social media
* work-from-home surveillance and other worker-productivity dystopias
* 'lobotomize your coffeemaker'
