* try sharing data as visualisation or through [soft modelling](/mdx/earth/soft-modelling) as narrative
* in selecting data to un-silo, the most important and most lacking first - [transitional overcorrection](/docs/earth/transitional-overcorrection), missing voices
* directly document the choices you make as the archivist
* include or link to the full context of larger data, interviews etc
* consider interface, consider physical infrastructure of access
* mindfully avoid creating new hierarchies in the access and framing
* interface also crucial to interpretation
* as is [labelling](/mdx/earth/label-well) and commentary or [annotation](/mdx/earth/annotations-and-marginalia) - define terms clearly

- consider the power you have as a researcher, before you bring marginalised voices in, avoiding thinking on their behalf
- from your position you may have privileges to harness [check your privilege](/docs/earth/check-your-privilege)
- balancing your intention/purpose with others'
