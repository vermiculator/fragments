the ability/practise of applying more general advice to a specific scenario, or gaining specific value from a situation based on the specifics of your own position/perspective/context

***

applying a template, blueprint, set of instructions, advice, etc to your own situation is a really valuable skill - modifying based on resources and requirements is a hugely important part of resilience and adaptivity.

one of the many reasons to be wary of LLMs - auto-applying templates without awareness of the context of use means often applying them wrong/unhelpfully/dangerously. it is impossible and undesirable for an LLM to hold your entire context - local models are better, but still cannot account for your embodied experience
