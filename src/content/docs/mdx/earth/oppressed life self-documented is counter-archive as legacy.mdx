## Mentions

* "What is crucial here, and what makes this practice much different from [sousveillance](/mdx/earth/sousveillance) (which Grossman’s work might resemble at first glance) is that this performatively reconfigured function of a recording device is not explicitly motivated against the hegemonic power, but by a will to construct a particular, singular, and disparate account of a given time and space (potentially productive and informative beyond the here and now, and only then, perhaps, capable of serving as evidence to balance the hegemonic archive)."
