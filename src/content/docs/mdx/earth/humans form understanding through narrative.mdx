## The Concept

Humans build narratives for their lives, relationships and experiences to make sense of the combination of disparate moments. We create meaning and form connections based on our perspective of events mixed with existing beliefs and future additions to externally accepted truths. Eyewitness testimony is said to be unreliable as memory is fallible, we have cognitive and we tend to favour narrative cohesion.

## Notes

* 'life must be lived forward but can only be understood backwards'
* the past and future don't exist, memory and perspective
* affects of trauma sometimes avoided by forming a cohesive narrative with active participation, shock formed by unprocessed narrative and helplessness
