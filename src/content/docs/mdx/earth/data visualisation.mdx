* communicating with non-data people
* data doesn't belong to the specialists
* starts in visual expression through glyphs, pictograms etc
* in [The Age of Noise](/mdx/library/the-age-of-noise) we have so much data we need more data visualisation more and more now as we have more and more data
* human attention spans decreasing
* Why is data visualisation effective? Theories from cognitive psychology, design, gestalt processes, neuro-aesthetics, science of decision-making and persuasion
* Sight most cognitively powerful sense
* the speed at which we process visual information is roughly equivalent to the bandwidth of a computer network (?)
* we disregard much of the information we are processing
* about 0.7% of what we perceive is what we are aware of
* RGB is based on our own anatomy (what ocur rods and cones process) but CYMK on ink chemistry
* reflected light turned into electrochemical signals, through optic nerve into occipital lobe in the back of brain
* all senses have two modes of operation, pre-attentive processing (system 1) and attentive processing (system 2)
* System 1 is quick/automatic/habit/subconscious/irrational/impulsive and System 2 does long-term planning, conscious thought, calculation, rational, deliberate, more precise
* system 2 more 'trustworthy' I agree for the most part but system 1 is wired for survival, so trust those trauma instincts if they still serve you, they're there to protect you
* consciously processing stimuli must be done in serial which is why it is slower (I swear parallel thought is a thing though? Or maybe just very fast serial)
* when making data visualisations you'll be in system 2 but a viewer is likely in system 1 (or at least that's what they use first)
* use visual characteristics deliberately to trigger instinct in the viewer, eg colour, form, shape, size, distances, spatial presentation, motion (fast-twitch in particular)
* gestalt principles ie proximity, enclosure
* the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts
* it takes effort to even start switching to system 2 so we often stay in system 1
