the way 'luddism' is often framed in general discussion is as anti-tech, tech-dystopian, anti-progress-of-any-kind, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', anti-change

a frequent misrepresentation of original luddites, who protested forced mechanisation with more politically-centred critical thought behind it. see [anti-exploitative luddism](/mdx/earth/anti-exploitative-luddism)
