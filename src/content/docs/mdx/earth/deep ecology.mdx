## The Concept

A philosophy of ecocentrism in which every living thing has inherent value, and asserts that humans are part of nature rather than superior and separate from it. [(1)](https://www.treehugger.com/what-is-deep-ecology-philosophy-principles-and-criticism-5191550)

## Notes

* Critiqued as overly broad and vulnerable to being co-opted by eco-fascists (eg endorsing population reduction)

## Mentions

* "If a psychological theory is not true ecologically, it is not true. That is, if it does not apply equally well to plants and chipmunks and bacteria, it isn’t foundationally true.” (Stephen Buhner)  [➡](/mdx/library/life-is-at-bottom-diversity#block-04ba06)
* "By the late twentieth century in U.S. scientific culture, the boundary between human and animal is thoroughly breached \[...] "language, tool use, social behaviour, mental events - nothing really convincingly settles the separation of human and animal."
