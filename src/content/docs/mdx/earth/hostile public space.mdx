* crucially, the treatment of unhoused people, and how that also trickles out to everyone else
* on car supremacy and walkability
* [monumentual architecture](/mdx/earth/monumentual-architecture)
* Built environment affects autistics beyond need for isolated sensory rooms, we need more consideration in general public space to allow us to be in it rather than escape it. Factors of the built environment can also dictate social expectations and affect behaviour of others, clear procedure, [affordances](/mdx/earth/affordances) and signage is crucial
* benches
  * deliberately uncomfortable design, often entirely unusable
  * cruel anti-sleeping measures
  * disadvantages many already disadvantaged people
    * homeless people
    * disabled people
    * pregnant people
    * elderly people
    * young children
    * those caring for young children
  * lack of seating at many bus stops, those that do have seating have inadequate seating, and people who use buses are more likely to be the already disadvantaged groups mentioned above
  * Benches as a haven for the stressed, anxious, autistic, etc, scouting location
* kinda opposite of this is the public safety measures built into environments such as flood prevention and bollarding with planters and artworks (or just actual bollards)
