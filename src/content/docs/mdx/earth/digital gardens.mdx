A digital space; a collection of notes continuously edited. Digital gardens encourage you to tend to thoughts of varying levels of maturity in a hyperconnected single space. Ideas are seeds that sprout into bigger ideas. There is no hierarchy of draft/document - unfinished thoughts are welcome.

"there's no reason why you *have* to stick with the digital garden metaphor, which appears to be approaching the end of its shelf life. While the metaphor of the garden conjures up pastoral images \[...] I'd prefer it to be like the sprawling, abandoned estate of Heligan in Cornwall - but in its wild, overgrown form, *before* its rediscovery after a century and transformation into a tourist attraction," - [dokoissho](https://dokoissho.hmm.garden/01f5e3xd5ctfk8dthsb01v7ywn)

[digital ecologies](/mdx/earth/digital-ecologies) - "Gardens are by their very nature narcissistic: they're about their owners and their personal tastes and idiosyncrasies rather than the world at large, inward rather than outward looking."
