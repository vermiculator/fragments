* "everyday practices of photographic documentation have become an intrinsic layer of an apparatus of “ambient intelligence” constituted by a network of technological infrastructures"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0yanpryzm3x6vqv7kk026nb)
* * "the ambient nature of the contemporary capturing and archiving of our everyday lives."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ye4vebefq9adc7racvm44m)
    * ### [go slow](/mdx/earth/go-slow) - instance and ubiquity as primary concerns?

    * "The slogan “Remember everything” displayed on the welcoming page is followed by a brief explanation of the service’s function, expressing the ideas of instance and ubiquity, important characteristics of capture culture: “Capture a note once, and it’s instantly available on all your devices."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ydqp40q1vy2e9q53fp25j6)

    * "Users can capture their memories on the go, with no special regard for space, conditions, time, and social circumstances. But while the software is “everywhere,” constituting a spatio-material hybrid described by Greenfield as “everyware” (Greenfield, 2006), where is the human behind it? As we have just seen, the captured memories might become inserted into the layers of a larger automated technological infrastructure, in which individual control over accessibility can become quite tenuous. Alongside the perpetual changes that a software and its terms of use undergo, the value (both the personal and the techno-value orchestrating today’s data economies) becomes subject to modulation. How is the personal value modulated"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ydy5sjy03nnh3acs1qctnr)
* ### "convenience and immediacy, and its flip side, ambient, techno-surveillance"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yvx7z60gaw4r8azavc54kw) [(Smolicki, 2017)](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture#block-f826e7)
  * transactional data exchange
  * "as embodying the larger phenomenon of the convenience-surveillance trade-off,"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ydztt6aav9h1b6wb89f8cg)
  * "the transactional character of mnemotechnologies in capture culture."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ye0ha4yandpy52dceatq5p)
  * "If today, as Wendy Chun argued, the user of a given digital service or software is produced and programmed through the very act of using this software (Chun, 2011), the same can be said of an individual media practitioner committed to the use of a mnemotechnological platform such as Facebook, which, consciously or not, turns him/her into a micro-archiving subject and object of another kind of micro-archiving. What this further means is that mnemotechnologies, such as Facebook and the like, have an inherently transactional nature, not subject to modulation in accordance with the principles inscribed in these mainstream mnemotechnologies."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yvq5r89k2kqbqv6qh1wn8t)
  * "One early project that addressed this issue was a mobile phone application openpaths. It allows smartphone users to decide how they want their data to be used. It protects the locative data, but one can also decide to share it with specific research initiatives, art projects, or educational programs of choice (House, 2011)."
