* infrastructurally, social, systemically, etc
* Paris and its history of protest, Haussmann engineered large thoroughfares to prevent street fighting, commissioned by Louis Napoleon following 1848 revolution (see also Paris on [advertisement](/mdx/earth/antiadvertisement))
* large concrete buildings and plazas of US uni campuses are to diffuse demonstrations
* interesting how wide flat spaces are used like this, complex and many-forked areas are better for protest, organisation, escape, capture of space etc
