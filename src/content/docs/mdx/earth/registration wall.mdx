* Like paywalls, but for registration.
* demanding an account is made to access content when it is almost always unnecessary
* used as a marketing strategy to get email addresses
* or otherwise to gather details on your audience, a form of tracking/analytics
* the worst (and annoyingly common) culprits offer the first paragraph or so of an article then block access to the rest
* sometimes bypassable (e.g. disabling javascript or using an external proxy) but often not
* probably wreaks havoc with screen readers too
