So frequently across all human cultures we have such variety in how we use our hands and what for. Here I wanted to bring together a few areas that interest me in how this tool-use compares and differs with varying purpose and ability.

***

* Handcrafts, needlework to woodwork
* String instruments and fingering, piano
* Hand based metrics and measurements, hand counting
* Massage and similar
* Hand-arm-shoulder symphony
* Hand based injury, tendons etc and rest, arthritis, joints
* Hand anatomy and mechanics, fine dexterity
* Public functions reliant on hand function eg types of door handles and tools for this
* Hand prosthetics, tremors, balance, control and grip, and supporting tools for this
* force enhancement for operating large machinery eg using moment, leverage,  gears
* Fingertips, identity, sensitivity
* Hand-based analogies, phrases, iconography, symbolism etc
* Stimming and fidgeting with hands, tools for regulation
* Body focused repetitive behaviour with the hands- nail biting, nail picking, skin picking, scratching, plucking
* How amputees replace hand function
* Hands in sports and performance, proper form, shadow puppets
* Tools for communication - sign, Braille and touch-sign
* does experiencing the world through your hands a deafblind person station you in your body more down there than up here (ie sight-primary-sense people often associate their soul or self or embodiment as in their head, in their brain or behind the eyes) - does their psyche deprioritise the upper parts or is the biological imperative too strong or possibly the social implications of facial expression (or at least face/gaze direction) overrides this
* as very sensitive tools for pleasure and affection
* comparing the style of hand-protection worn in specific professions eh archery glove, artist glove, shamisen player hand thing, cycling gloves, those ring splint things
