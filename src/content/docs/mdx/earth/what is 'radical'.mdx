* there are 'good' and 'bad' contexts
* radical meaning grabbing the problem by the root
* radical left is only radical because the centre has moved further and further right
* but also 'extremism' and radical seen as bad, polarisation of political spectrum etc
* radical is only subjective, dependent entirely on one particular cultural norm
* plenty of outsiders considered radical for harmless reasons as well as those for harmful ones
* radical in terms of revolution vs reform, how slow can we afford to be, who is brought along with us, we aren't free till we're all free
* many 'radical' beliefs quite simple and gentle but the norm is for polite and quiet forms of violence built into the infrastructures of society
* who decides who is a terrorist?
* a radical approach in some areas often harmful but not always eg radical surgery
* but are any areas always/inherently harmful?
  * Can't think of an example.
    * eg a radical approach to a good thing could be good or bad and a radical approach to a bad thing probably still bad, anything else's radical approach could be either
  * adding 'radical' qualifier to a bad thing doesn't necessarily change its inherent badness
    * eg radical genocide doesn't change the fact of genocide being awful
    * might just indicate scale of impact.
* might just be getting into sematic weeds
