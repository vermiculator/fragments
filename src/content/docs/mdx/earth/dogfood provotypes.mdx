In the spirit of [dogfooding](/mdx/earth/dogfooding) I personally have built an endless number of half-finished systems that I abandoned before using due to changing requirements, environments and technical contexts. I've learnt and lost and relearnt a lot of specific technical knowledge in these processes, and wasted a lot of time. I still love to half-build things; I respect the process, and am considering how to document partial practise. I'm currently enjoying the notion of 'provotypes' [(Smolicki, 2017)](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture#block-3cbdd3), a term I identify in my practise of designing/building half-complete prototypes as a learning exercise. The artifact is either abandoned or remixed or iterated later on, but the process and insights have ongoing use and impact of 'provoking' insight.
