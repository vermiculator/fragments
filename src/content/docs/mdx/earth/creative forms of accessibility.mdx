* where is there room to be creative in the pursuit of accessibility
* eg design methodologies that are inherently creative
* but also more expressive forms eg allowing creative expression in AAC and allowing subtitles to be expressed creatively are very different, due to who it is empowering
* creative subtitles can actually hamper accessing information but other times ensure the same playful spirit is experienced by all -- when is it appropriate, does it just depend on the content/need for a direct literal option alongside
* 'creativity' in terms of creative, unusual, experimental solutions
* but often reliability is more important
* example - where's Wally on audiobook exists - audio formats of silly books, game books and art books - is this still an enjoyable experience in audio or is it a novelty? Is it ok to be a novelty given the original is a novelty of a different kind?
