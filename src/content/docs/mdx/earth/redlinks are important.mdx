* wiki redlink - the absent link, the lacuna, just as important [Ted Nelson on hypertext](/mdx/library/ted-nelson-on-hypertext) and [(Rettburg, 2005)](/mdx/library/all-together-now-collective-knowledge-collective-narratives-and-architectures-of-participation)
* highlighting that which is absent
* linkages we don't yet see, information we don't yet have
  \- adjacent stuff may be relevant
  \- others' [annotations and marginalia](/mdx/earth/annotations-and-marginalia) can be useful
  \- "Locating Digitised Marginalia"
* seeds for future work
* see in [(Smolicki, 2017)](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture), 'what we might say'
