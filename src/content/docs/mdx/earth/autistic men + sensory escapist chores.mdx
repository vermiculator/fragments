* chores 'traditionally' left to men in many societies (but especially the US media prototypical suburban family) are often the ones of singular focus and sensory escape whereas the ones left to women are multi-modal and full-sensory
* eg men hunt alone and women cook together, men go out to do fixing or yard work whilst women communally child rear
* even counts for leisure sometimes eg the men fish and golf when the women shop and take the children out
* these 'men's' chores give time to escape and reflect on the environments that women are stuck in. when the home is the workplace you're never at home/at rest.
* this contributes to a certain profile of man having existed for forever, who is very good at a subset of chores and doesn't 'deal with' any other subset of things (other factors being general patriarchy and authoritarianism and capitalism)
* the kind of man that was/is expected under a lot of societies is one that fits very well for a certain profile of autism
* so a spiky profile that favours these singular absorbed tasks away from the sensory overwhelm of housework and children goes [aberrant behaviour is pathologised](/mdx/earth/aberrant-behaviour-is-pathologised) in these kinds of societies
* and autistic women (and other neurotypes) are the ones pathologised (albeit under any variety of hysteria) for not being able to handle the multi-modal sensory hellscape of running a house, rearing children, and socialising in the expected manner
