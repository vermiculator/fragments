As a collection of [living documents](/mdx/earth/living-documents), a [digital garden](/mdx/earth/digital-gardens) is continuously updated, with notes of varying completeness. This may include new ideas that haven't yet been backed up by reputable sources. As [digital gardens are never 'finished'](/mdx/earth/digital-gardens-are-never-finished), there will always be areas that need further citation.
