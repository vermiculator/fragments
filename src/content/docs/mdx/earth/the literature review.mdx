### advice

* follow curiosity
* challenge assumptions and narratives
* consider what is know, unknown and contested
* start small, be critical and make links between sources.
* use it iteratively, consider how each source informs your own methods

### purpose

* literature review justifies your research
* what are current trends and how to fit within and diverge from
* check sources of other papers, can refute or back up other research
* more like film review - own perspective and critical analysis
* provides your context to move forward
* use other people's work to situate your work
* we have assumptions to confirm/correct
* form relation to others interested in the topic

### methods

* does it make sense in the current context or publishing context
* locate and engage with existing works
* synthesise existing knowledge and ideas
* can concern web sources/social media/web platforms also, wider inspirations
* show how each source contributes to our understanding of the research problem
* how the sources connect -- plus new perspectives from their combination
* understand how existing work relates to your inquiry
* identify tensions or gaps
* position your own practice and methods within these conversations
* could be academic articles, book chapters, policy reports, design case studies, or examples of speculative practice
* reflect on the assumptions, frameworks, and methods used
* make connections
* explain how each source informs your own framing/choices.

### critical analysis

* comparative analysis - highlight differences and similarities, strengths and weaknesses
* historical analysis - traces evolution of ideas over time
* methodological analysis, strengths and weaknesses of research designs
* theoretical analysis - assess validity and applicability of conceptual frameworks

### synthesis strategies

* identify patterns or themes
* construct taxonomies, classifications to organise
* visual maps to illustrate relationships between concepts
* develop integrative frameworks to combine insights from various studies

### prompts

* What assumptions are made in this text?
* Who is included or excluded in the analysis?
* How does the text frame inequality, power, or justice — or does it avoid doing so?
* Could you apply or adapt this methodology? Why or why not?
* What new questions or directions did the text open up?
