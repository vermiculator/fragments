### in philosophy and anthropology

* the 'primal' humans
  * a multitude of ways people engage with the concept of a primal self, theories/frameworks/approaches to exploring this in modern life/times/cultures/research
    * eg reptilian brain/limbic system
    * calisthenics,
    * infant reflexes,
    * nature/nurture debates,
    * pre-verbal and mentalese,
    * homosapien+
  * fear, survival, trauma and psychology
    * ![img]('../assets/reactions.jpg')
* primal vs animalistic
* 'primal urges' and 'primal instincts'
  * !\[img]\('../assets/primal instincts.jpg')
* 'savage' and colonialism and the construction of whiteness [de\~colonialism](/mdx/earth/decolonialism), [indigenous peoples' rights](/mdx/earth/indigenous-peoples-rights), [Whiteness](/mdx/earth/whiteness)
* thinking on how our body map determines so much of how we relate to each other and the world (what it feels like to be a bat, nagel(?) )

### in sex ([content warning/fetish](/mdx/plain/structural/caveats/content-warning/fetish))

* primal roleplay
  * primal interpreted variously as both human and animal
* specific animal roleplay
  * only kinds practised/discussed widely enough to allow for gatherings/media/being at all researchable are ponyplay, puppyplay and kittenplay
  * whilst some are more body focused (eg cow fetishes often related to udders and lactation, a trait easily transferred between cow and human species),
  * some are more straightforward aesthetic and behavioural matches (eg commonly kittenplay appears more aesthetic/cuteness focused or adjacent to 'brat' identities)
  * but many of these specific interests cover ways of relating, crossing over with other kink-associated relationship dynamics such as training/ownership/service aspects of ponyplay and puppyplay
  * interesting how some people transfer these ways of relating with animals to alternative ways of relating with other humans

## in body, media, performance

* body maps in general are fascinating
  \- annihilation film played with that in some fun ways
  \- foetal development
  \- amorphous globosus ([content warning/gore](/mdx/plain/structural/caveats/content-warning/gore))
* experiments of people-as-animal like [GoatMan](/mdx/library/goatman), in performance art, traditions, rituals
* wild sheep chase novel
