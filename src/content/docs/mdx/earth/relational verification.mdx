mechanisms that base trust on relation between two forms of identification eg when you have access to two accounts on different platforms, embedding/plugin/linking verification on both accounts confirms the link between them exists. viewers may find something more trustworthy than something else or that the link verifies cohesive online identity (not spoofed)

Used on Mastodon (and likely other fediverse platforms)
