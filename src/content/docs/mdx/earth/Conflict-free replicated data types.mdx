I reviewed a paper on this during my degree and didn't think about it again until I saw it mentioned in the Redecentralize Digest — July 2019

* "great potential is seen in data synchronisation protocols like [Dat](https://datproject.org/) in combination with [Conflict-free Replicated Data Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) (CRDTs), with which the lab created several experiments."
* So I would like to review this again

"Anytype encrypts and versions each block separately (with CRDTs). " - [r/Anytype](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anytype/comments/1k4w1pw/comment/moea18u/)
