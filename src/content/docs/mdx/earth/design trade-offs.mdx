## The Concept

Design involves compromise and prioritising particular goals in order to achieve *something* for *someone* rather than aiming for generalised 'perfection' with unlimited scope. Subjective ideas of acceptable performance are useful benchmarks and it's important to be aware of which trade-offs are being made either implicitly or explicitly.
