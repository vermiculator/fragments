## colonialism

* colonialism as a global system of domination driven by European conquest, trade and empire
* occupation, extraction, cultural suppression
* 'justified' through racial hierarchies, [white saviour narrative](/mdx/earth/white-saviour-complex), missionary work
* orientalism, East vs West, North vs South, etc
* not just the 'legacy' of colonialism, the structures still surround us
* [decolonising research](/mdx/earth/decolonising-research)
* hierarchies of race, culture, bodies, religion
* making land, resources and social systems 'legible' to colonisers, by erasing identity
* less 'developed' nations supposedly in need of guidance
* institutions that still dominate often directly profited (and still exist due to the ongoing effects of) colonialism
* museums, collections, 'primitive' objects and knowledge systems, [ripped from context](/mdx/earth/ripped-from-context)
