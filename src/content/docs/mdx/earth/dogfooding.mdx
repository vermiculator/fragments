not sure of origins, but a term used in tech - 'eat your own dog food', that is to use your own tools, a preference to make things you use yourself and use things you make yourself

benefits include [experiential knowledge](/mdx/earth/experiential-knowledge), familiarity with use cases and likelihood to come across bugs

may produce [conflict of interest](/mdx/conflict-of-interest), preference for your own use case, over others', slow progress, neglected documentation, etc

often just happens out of necessity - no tech suited to your requirements so you built it 'in-house' - but ability to do this is strongly dependent on in-house capacity
