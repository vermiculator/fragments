## Mentions

* "The highest form of human connection is self-transcendence (Maslow, 1969) wherein there is a feeling of harmony with greater humanity (Raney et al., 2020). This entails rising above personal needs or intergroup differences and experiencing solidarity with humankind (Koltko-Rivera, 2006), which is strengthened by prosocial behavior and working toward a common good (Fredrickson, 2001)."
