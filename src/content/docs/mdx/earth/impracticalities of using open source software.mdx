* incompatibilities with other software - gap in the offerings covered by proprietary software that doesn't play well will others
* ecosystem lock-in in general
* open source development is often limited by lack of maintainers or lack of funding (and therefore those who can volunteer freely)
* poorly documented complex setups
* generally not being well suited to collaborative work due to the above reasons/single author dogfooding bespoke setups
* usually lacking in UX work/good UI
* trustworthiness/non-established brand/layperson unwilling to sacrifice ease and familiarity
