* for personal use people don't always save source metadata, depending on context this metadata isn't always necessary for instrumental usage, or visual inspirations aren't always tracked directly
* different platforms, site cultures, offline cultures etc encourage and discourage and lay varying priority on keeping track of [knowledge lineage](/mdx/earth/knowledge-lineage), authorship, contribution, etc
* contribution in open source cultures
* [tumblr](/mdx/entities/tumblr) and others finding/adding source later in reblogs
* [Pinterest](/mdx/entities/pinterest) and bookmarking with direct source, but [link rot](/mdx/earth/link-rot)
* metadata inaccuracies and varying importance, priority on fixing them
* misattributed quotes, inaccurate folk attributions, etc
