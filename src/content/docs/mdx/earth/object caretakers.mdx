* as we ramp down overproduction we'll need emphasis on maintenance of existing objects
* some things require specialist care by artisans eg leathers
* other things require more widespread 'folk' knowledge to recirculate again around proper care and maintenance of eg clothing items
* as with commoning space, possession and care, we'll need [to common](/mdx/earth/commoning) the care of objects
* this exists to some extent with the conservation and care of buildings and collections of historical/cultural interest
* 'caretakers' generally employed in buildings, grounds or for monuments (eg the chalk horse) but could be assigned more closely to subsets or instances of objects and materials, as with specialist craftspeople
