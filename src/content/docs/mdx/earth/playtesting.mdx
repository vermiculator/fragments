* watch people play!
* can focus on specific mechanics or narratives but need to still situate it in context of the wider game environment/chronology/interface
* feedback should be used strategically to iterate, to fix problems, to find correct audience etc
* analyse trends in feedback to adjust game mechanics, interface and content
* upload mockups as soon as they’re drafted to see how people respond - mock website, images or storyboard
* It’s difficult to assess three-hours of narrative gameplay with a short demo so focused sessions are useful
* most important to test around your core game loop and features you’re currently progressing on
* you know where your design weaknesses are if you see a pattern in users stalling
* playtesting is a method of interacting with another person through your work
* extra methods specific to games
  * closed beta for insight into longer play sessions to look at longer-term retention
  * tools you can use for a beta: TestFlight for mobile games, a release channel on Oculus for VR Oculus games. Steam provides the Steam Playtest feature, which allows developers to give access to players via access keys.
  * screenshots on Reddit, or [https://www.alphabetagamer.com/](https://www.alphabetagamer.com/), or local community events
* people don't know how to engage with interactive art, the problems are the same
* testing with fresh perspective, cold reactions
* focused vs general playtest
* don't always know what your question is, looking at broader behaviours
* patterns point you to the insights
* primary secondary tertiary priorities
* don't overinvest in early versions
* how did it make you feel is actually a really useful q, its about emotion and embodiment
