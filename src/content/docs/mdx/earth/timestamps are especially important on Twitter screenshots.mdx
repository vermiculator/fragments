a) for general cultural relevance, expected audience of the tweets, size of impact
b) being on the platform at all can indicate likely cultural/political affiliations in it's earlier days and post-Elon days
c) blue checkmarks can indicate a level of trust in pre-Elon tweets and no longer hold this meaning

Implications for digital archiving, use of tweets as historical sources. eg a tweet from a public figure holds more weight and more trust in 2012-2019 (estimated period).
