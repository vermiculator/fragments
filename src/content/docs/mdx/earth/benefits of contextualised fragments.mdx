* lacking authorship
* lacking info on perspectives/purposes embedded in its creation
* 'raw' or 'atomic' is still contestable - what is an [atom](/mdx/earth/atomic-content) in this context, anything that provides meaning? right down to a single bit? 'raw' likely still has context embedded in it that is now obscured and assumed universal. define everything, everything relies on something else, everything takes a perspective
* satire, devices employed for teaching, unfiltered early thoughts etc taken out of context of their assumed truth/falsity/etc
* cross-cultural mismatch, translation error
