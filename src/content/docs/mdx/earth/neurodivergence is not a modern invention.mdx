* natural part of human diversity
* maybe particular neurotypes have evolved in different ways over time but there has always been a range
* no neurotype is inherently more or less valuable than another
* the rise in diagnoses is due to spreading awareness, changing socioeconomic conditions, an increasingly connected world, etc
* it is not a fad to be 'suddenly autistic', the language and conversations are just becoming more public
* past treatments of people diverging from the neuro-norms varied wildly
  * psychiatric asylum
  * harmful psychiatric treatments
  * infant abandonment
  * acceptance and understanding and community support
  * placed into a specific niche role that fulfils requirements with their talents
  * isolated roles away from human interaction or similar
  * disabled people considered divine across several religions and belief systems
* examples of how this could look
* changelings and sheepherds
