* when people interact with objects they can in some way 'inhabit' or 'occupy'
* this kind of interaction implies a 1to1 relationship with a property of the object
* eg to sit in a chair, occupying the space or the surface, only one person traditionally occupies, but these are often flexible rules eg more places can be set at a table, no set relation
* often interacting with objects in multiple ways at once, or multiple actors interact with one object in different ways concurrently
* connection to concurrent computing, physical object interactions may or may not deal with the same concepts eg race conditions, locking, ordering and priority
* also collision and 'using' space, examining objects in space, the semantic and mathematical natures of relations like 'in', spaces as sets and categories, vector maths
* occupying a house, occupying a large vehicle, running functions and logistics of a building, to what extent go people 'embody' or relate with spaces they use for different purposes, spaces that move, and spaces they control or direct , spaces they mechanically maintain.
