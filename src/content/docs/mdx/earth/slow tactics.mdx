“inventive employment of possibilities within strategic circumstances” (Highmore, 2002, p.159)

***

tactics as anti-reactionary forms of disruption
tactics for creation, production, for the long-term
tactics as alternative perspective, alternative dimension

***

everyday practises of self-actualisation and self-transcendence
collective action through habits and healing and learning and sharing and building
resistive action as bottom-up dismantling
