* describe liking something 'ironically' as it having genuine appeal to you but the things you like about it are things you don't think were deliberate -- seeded by video on AI doc
* but I also have this sort of 'charming but they didn't mean it to be' feeling about much of Star Trek TOS but wouldn't consider it 'ironic' viewing
* relates to cringe culture and being earnest
* I earnestly enjoy Star Trek TOS but with awareness of the limitations, is this all 'guilty' pleasures are?
