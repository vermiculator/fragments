attention economy, internet bloat, patience, slowing down, resisting big tech control of attention and hyperproductivity, deliberate and thoughtful

not everything needs to be instant, in fact very little needs to be instant
instant loading etc
its more about communicating accurately and clearly the waiting time required, dos this become a multi-step task.

thinking about how high-usage servers even out time, eg with heavy downloads there's a countdown (sometimes for ads, annoying) sometimes just to manage server load, and that is so reasonable and responsible and often this reasoning is made very clear

links to how 'seamless' experience actually just obfuscates the labour and resources that go into an experience
