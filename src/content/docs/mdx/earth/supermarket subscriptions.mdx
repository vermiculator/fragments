* conceptual brainstorm on supermarket subscriptions for transition to uncommodified basic supplies
* Use data from eg Tesco Clubcard accounts to estimate any relevant average of spending and transfer to a subscription of that amount in lieu of paying for individual items
  * products still tracked to account for supply/demand logistics
  * can start by making use of existing specific funds
    * eg gov funding for low-income families
    * eg non-profit funding for marginalised groups
    * eg charity funding for those with specific disabilities
  * and/or use this funding to make up any difference in supply cost to lower costs for consumers
  * funnelling funding directly to everyday groceries for as many as possible
  * with goal to eliminate any cost forwarded to consumer but still paying supplier
  * pushes food supply labour costs onto collective purpose-driven groups and state
  * this could ideally support adjacent work in un-commodifying basic supplies and end in entirely cost-free local production and supply that ensures widespread food security
  * or at least turns 'feeding the nation' directly to a financial collective responsibility, for which the state is more pressured to fulfil
  * or at possibly moves the pressure onto local producers which would hopefully inspire pressure on the state through greater collaboration across the industry
  * may produce tension from producers or desire from companies to source from further away
  * may produce social tension in early stages if subsidised subscriptions are unevenly spread
  * may be awful in implementation as with similar schemes due to over-bureaucratic procedure
  * may require small logistical work on implementing item limits according to supply forecasts
  * what is the motive for higher-ups at the supermarket companies to accept no longer making profit?
  * administrative costs? almost certainly can be dealt with if removing any allowance of profit
  * how to un-motivate competition between the various big supermarkets?
  * is it even worth making a business-focused argument when it is inherently a socio-economic-political pressure necessary to achieve this socio-economic-political goal? it is worth financial analysis obviously if implemented but maybe not worth justification in purely financial terms as a pitch
  * some uk big ones wanted to merge recently? was it sainsburys + asda? what was their motivation?
  * look to examples of food banks and similar for their more honest appraisal of cost and their experience in minimising waste and taking advantage of all possible resources
