factors are wider but I'm speaking from experience of the post-millennium UK primarily.

## Notes

* a very subjective designation
* on the current day middle class as a much larger proportion of the population
* diverse needs and a diverse range of actual wealth and potential of earning
* some of the middle class are elites, owning multiple properties and investments, and/or very high earnings
* but much of the middle class are actually a generally-comfortable portion of the working class. the kind that are just one step away from financial ruin - maybe own their one property or still paying for it, wealth dependent on career capital that is dependent on their continued good health, on maintaining their steady stream of income
* in reality, the middle class may not necessarily exist. are you a manager or are you managed? can you afford sick days? general questions like this are more useful in determining power balance and wealth disparity
* more relevant when considered as a *culture* than as a class, an supposedly-aspirational aesthetic for the tenuously-safe portion of the working class and a comfortable middle-ground for elites embarrassed by their wealth
