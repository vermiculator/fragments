## The Concept

* Traversing networks to find what we're looking for, or something else entirely. Considering paradigms that aren't based on search engines and web crawling. Moving beyond social media algorithms and ambiguously trained AI to surface what a trusted curator might present us with. Novel mechanisms of linking disparate web spaces.
