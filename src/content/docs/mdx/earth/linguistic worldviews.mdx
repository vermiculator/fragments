A surprising amount of a person's understanding of the world is shaped by slightly different language structures and subtleties of meaning.

* vocab that does and doesn't form a synonym or antonym
* tones, gestures, facial expressions that mean very different things across cultures and languages
* grammatical forms that come with attached significance or meaning to particular subtleties or particular subjects or objects

## Mentions

* "there are cultures and languages where *the past* is conceptualised as *what can be seen*, i.e. in the direction we are facing, and where *the future* is conceptualised as *what can’t be seen*, i.e. in the opposite direction that lies behind us" - [➡](/mdx/library/life-is-at-bottom-diversity#block-cbe442)
