the surrounding context by which you decode media, and apply comparative or oppositional meanings, or a combination (a negotiated state)

***

"Hall’s proposed three distinctive positions that individuals can obtain in relation to media. The first option is a dominant hegemonic position. It is a situation in which the viewer takes the connoted meaning “full and straight and decodes the message in term of reference code in which it has been encoded” (ibid. 1993, p.101). In such a case, the viewer is “operating inside the dominant code” (ibid., p.101). The second option is a negotiated position. Decoding the message in this modality is based on a mixture of adaptive and oppositional elements which is to say that it acknowledges the dominant meaning, but adopts it to a particular situatedness, or as Hall puts it, “situated logics” (ibid., p.102). The third position is an oppositional stance. In this, one “detotalizes the message in the preferred code in order to retotalize the message within some alternative framework of reference” (ibid., p.103). This means that the receiver of the message is fully aware of the content (which could be for instance a recognition of its manipulative or persuasive underlying, in the context of social media one could think of it being its economic and commercial underlying) and so either rejects it altogether or accepts it but with a deliberate subversion of the meaning that the arriving media text is inscribed with. Hall’s pluralization of the modes of interacting with media content questions the view on media as an entirely hegemonic apparatus that instigates only one kind of subordinate reactions."
