## Mentions

* "the “googlization” of everyday life, memories are seen as “fixed entities patiently awaiting their retrieval from the shelves of the mental library” (van Dijck, 2005, p.327)." [(Smolicki, 2017)](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture#block-816d26)
* "critique of the tendency to perceive the human mind and archival storage as founded upon the same kinds of operations (see Bergson, 1896 \[1991] as well as the discussion in Paula Amad’s Counter Archive (2010, p.117)."
