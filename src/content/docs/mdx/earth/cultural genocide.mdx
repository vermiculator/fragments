## Notes

* the United Nations describes genocide as "the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group... it does not include political groups or so called 'cultural genocide'" and states "Cultural destruction does not suffice, nor does an intention to simply disperse a group" [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618180113/https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/Genocide%20Convention-FactSheet-ENG.pdf)
