## Highlights

* "the book's purpose is as a tool for social engagement." ([1](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2kh50qdhqm7keg754xx5nb0))

* "The book is presented as a walking guide, containing photographs of the residents and their own words, taken from interviews the artist conducted with them on the path." ([1](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2kh4s4pnqs4s5eg142y5tfx))

* "By moving from one pole to another, the robin participated in what the artist called his 'Drawing in Space'. Dibbets's book contains a series of photographs, topographical surveys, handwritten notes and printed text" ([1](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2kgnfq2reh1bkkchmqj1rg5))

* "sculptor, artist and performer [Liliane Lijn](http://www.lilianelijn.com/). *Sky never stops* is part of her series of 'poem machines' – cylindrical or conical structures printed with text which she began to make in 1962. The forms are fixed to motorised turntables which, when made to rotate, cause the words to accelerate and dissolve into a blur of movement.
  Lijn was inspired by Tibetan prayer wheels which traditionally contain printed prayers wrapped around a cylinder. Buddhists believe that when the cylinder is spun, the prayers are activated and fly out into the world. When spun, Lijn's texts lose their legibility but are invested with a new energy" ([1](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2kgrhpe6jm99mp6pjedjjjb))

* "the words of the poems are repeated in different combinations and with varying gaps between them so that they appear to be bobbing around on the surface of the page." ([1](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2kh0fdh8qh7rjxm2kcsrq40))

* "New meanings and associations are created as the words rearrange and recombine with one another from one line to the next" ([1](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2kh0qfytmggz9zkfm6epgy1))

* "Walsh sees the book not merely as a sequence of pages but as a sequence of spaces" ([1](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2kh6bmaphcbczdsthr07gct))

* "the notion of books as an artistic medium appealed to conceptual artists who believed in ideas over aesthetics" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2kgkvw8x6h4425n0mfgdp4a))

* "Another attraction was that books could be democratic" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2kgm07v92z98nebkg0xweac))

* Book - usually first person, speaking more informally but about critical content, digestible , maybe not traditional referencing but footnotes, introduces jargon terms, for a layperson - Articles for more recent up to date things

* for interesting view of what a book can be, see [Emergent Strategy - Shaping Change, Changing Worlds](/mdx/library/emergent-strategy---shaping-change-changing-worlds)

* manual book searchability?

* verso recto
