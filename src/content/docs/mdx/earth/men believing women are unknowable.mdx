* [often enough, men](/mdx/earth/not-all-men) express a confused-rage towards women having varied and complex thoughts, motivations and behaviours
* women are often compelled by dangerous situations to obfuscate their beliefs, agree with men's (poor) assessments of other women or otherwise behave in contradictory ways
* women are also just humans with complex thoughts, varied beliefs and the ability to change their mind
