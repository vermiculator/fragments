A common instance of [data overcollection](/mdx/earth/collect-less-data) and a result of legacy systems and legacy datasets more often than explicitly oppressive viewpoints. There are ways to conform with legal or operational requirements without arbitrarily placing trans and gender-variant people at disadvantage.

## Notes

* You probably don't need this data at all.
  * This includes gender, sex, maiden name, title
  * Title isn't required for mailing and other communications such as email rarely use formal address.
  * Gender and sex are personal information that is collected mostly arbitrarily and not used
  * Marketing segmentation is not a good enough reason to store this data [imo](/mdx/earth/imo), it is likely you're misjudging or overgeneralising the needs of your audience
* If you really actually do, consider:
  * Do you mean gender or sex?
    * You probably only need one or the other
    * Asking for sex alone is often discriminatory
    * Where this is often actually required and pertinent is often a medical setting but this is still often clumsy and over-reaching
      * eg if an illness presents the same regardless of sex, you don't need to know
      * eg if a medication isn't affected by pregnancy status, hormones etc, you don't need to know
* Ask more specific questions.
  * eg Do you need to know if the patient is a woman, or are you actually asking if they currently menstruate?
  * This benefits multiple oppressed groups eg:
    * safer and more comfortable for trans and gender-variant people to make intimate disclosures
    * gives clarity on information required to those with cognitive impairment or cognitive differences
    * gives space for disabled people and disease/accident survivors to be more accurate on parts they do or don't have and how they function
    * leaves room for those with both temporary and permanent hormonal differences, eg
      * intersex conditions
      * fertility treatment
      * pregnancy
      * menopause
      * etc
    * cross-cultural and cross-language interactions?? may remove ambiguity if respectful but specific language is used but not sure at all on this
      * this may not be transferable to certain cultures' methods of healthcare and discussing these topics
      * I do respect patient-focus over blanket 'solutions'
      * I need to find other sources on this, my own context is particularly loud here
* If gender is deemed necessary:
  * note that [Gender is not a Bool](/mdx/earth/gender-is-not-a-bool)
* If there are system/legal reasons to include it, consider
  * contacting your EDI department or IT department
  * making these fields optional
  * adding free text fields for self-identification
    * anecdotally and from personal experience, gender-variant people will abandon web forms with inadequate options if we can afford to
  * leaving this data empty
  * autofilling already held data
  * hiding this data from the user
  * autofilling blanket values for all records
  * updating data sources for enumerated options
    * eg more recent sources for title include Mx
    * use sources from reputable organisations with input from those affected
