* prevailing neurotypes are not pathologised despite being just as distinct as any other
* it is aberrant behaviour and ways of being that is punished under conformist societies
* so something pervasive in one culture may be 'symptomatic' in another
* so not everything that is considered a 'disorder' is inherently a 'problem' by any one definition
* those with genuinely disabling issues can go 'under the radar' as their surroundings and peers are (consciously or unconsciously)  supportive of this one particular way of being -- for better and for worse
*
