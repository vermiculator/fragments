## Mentions

* “All data is historical data, the product of a time, place, political, economic, technical and social climate. If you are not considering why your data exists and other datasets don’t, you are doing data science wrong.” — Melissa Terras (quoted in [How AI Image Generators Make Bias Worse](/mdx/library/how-ai-image-generators-make-bias-worse))
