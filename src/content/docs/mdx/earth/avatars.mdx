* representation
* AR and VR
* [animation and puppetry and automata](/mdx/earth/animation-and-puppetry-and-automata)
* how body mapping / sensing through digital tech can allow gestural embodied control of digital avatars

### on physical avatars

* Representative small figures present in almost all cultures?
* deities and idols
* voodoo dolls and use in the occult
* clown egg faces as copyright or just for posterity?

### on digital avatars

* what was that book I read on second life avatars?
* pic-crew style avatars as the latest in digital dress up dolls which came from paper dress up dolls
* any AI driven or photo-supported or computer-vision-supported avatars like
* in gaming - human fall flat, Miis, etc.
* from Second Life -> VRChat
* VR avatars and Vtubers and digital puppetry
* physical forms from photogrammetry.
* What would AR avatars look like?
* FPS, just a hand and a gun
* perspective of vs representation of
* unable to capture decision and mannerism
* accuracy, precision and perspective in reproductive works
* and does accuracy even matter
* holograms eg the ABBA tour
* regenerated movement eg posthumous reanimation - ethical?
* static representation more ethical than reanimated forms? reanimation akin to puppeteering a corpse? Does physicality make a difference? Learned models of Twitter accounts. [Doppelganger](/mdx/library/doppelganger).
* 'reanimation' when to animate is to form new static states and constrict the transition over time - adding an artificial dimension to a corpse too reliant on artistic choice? Forming new stories of a person not reliant on either external circumstance or self-determined with autonomy - denying closure - [humans form understanding through narrative](/mdx/earth/humans-form-understanding-through-narrative)
* [ai generated influencers](/mdx/earth/ai-generated-influencers)
