## Notes

* more align resource management 'games' with resource management simulation and modelling for real life use
* harness a direct problem solving capacity - people put immense amounts of 'work' into fictional resource management, self-directed labour - with connection to underlying data sources, rigorous review and application-specific game features, this could shift decision-making to localities and allow for self-governance
* 'gamification' of resource management but with primary attention paid to what sort of games people play and why
* actual power afforded to people who interact with the simulation.
* needs good peer review, clear consequential outcomes, focus on locality and purpose, affording enough power to those most directly affected and those most traditionally without power through other mechanisms
* self-evolving ecosystem of technologies, allowing users ultimate control
* essentially using the good (efficient, usable and fun) interfaces we have already iterated on for specific kinds of problems, for the equivalent kinds of problems in real life
* encoding the more variable nature of the real world as undecideables and reflecting the physical object as single source of truth as much as possible?
* look into current simulations and models and how they differ from those created for gaming specifically
