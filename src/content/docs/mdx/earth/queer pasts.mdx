She said, "Her parents took her away & brought back a son. Grandma said, "They had a funeral for their daughter & from then on had a son. The Lord put it into their head to do what was right." Grandma said, "So that's my cousin, Jed. I reckon he did all right. Again. This was 1913. NEVER use the excuse "product of their time."
