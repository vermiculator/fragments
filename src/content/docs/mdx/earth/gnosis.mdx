* a term with many meanings, uses and interpretations across common usage, academic usage and various religious contexts
* i use 'gnosis' here to refer to all forms of non-inherently-rational forms of knowledge, the non-cognitive and inherent, anything considered spiritual/philosophical/religious/occult/esoteric/otherworldly/cross-dimensional/mythical/of legend and folklore/mysticisms
* if there's a better catch-all, let me know - i do find the particulars of varying interpretations interesting to their own merits but find this the best umbrella term for my purposes right now
