* saving context with content is often neglected
  * digital metadata often inadequate
    * doesn't save the things that are meaningful to the collector
    * saves things commercially useful or useful to platform owner
  * the kinds of context people need
    * task based, topic based, etc
  * [original context helps in refinding](/mdx/earth/original-context-helps-in-refinding)
    * context of saving needed for bookmarking
      * (Hwang, Herder and Ronchetti, 2017)
      * "A Link Back to MemoryLane: The Role of Context in Bookmarking and Refinding"
    * discussion of context being important for revisiting sites - huangIRCHIVERInformationCentricPersonal2025
  * benefits of decontextualised content
    * 'raw' data eg text is reusable
      * interdisciplinarity
      * outside its usual reach
      * "A single piece of content can ultimately be used in many different contexts to the one for which it was originally intended." [quickref#^06b2bb](/mdx/quickref#block-06b2bb)
    *
  * problems of decontextualised content
    * lacking authorship
    * lacking info on perspectives/purposes embedded in its creation
    * 'raw' or 'atomic' is still contestable - what is an [atom](/mdx/earth/atomic-content) in this context, anything that provides meaning? right down to a single bit? 'raw' likely still has context embedded in it that is now obscured and assumed universal. define everything, everything relies on something else, everything takes a perspective
    * satire, devices employed for teaching, unfiltered early thoughts etc taken out of context of their assumed truth/falsity/etc
    * cross-cultural mismatch, translation error
