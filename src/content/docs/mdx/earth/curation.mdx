* quality is in the combination and reflections - but  "many social curation tools that facilitate nothing more than collection"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jy4e5eft54ehm9cavmfw9w9z)

## Mentions

* "Curation therefore encompasses practices of sorting, classifying, and labeling for the purposes of organization and display"  - [(Lui, 2015)](/mdx/library/public-curation-and-private-collection-the-production-of-knowledge-on-pinterest)
* "then categorized, labelled and possibly set in relation to other [externalized traces](/mdx/earth/externalised-memory)" - [(Smolicki, 2017)](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture)
* "If you really want to learn a body of knowledge or skills (or whatever other learning area you define), it is really hard to beat becoming a curator for that area. In a sense, this is what academics have always done." (Cobb, 2010)
