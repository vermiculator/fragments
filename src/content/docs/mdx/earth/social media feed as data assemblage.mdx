* the term assemblage refers to “wholes whose properties emerge from the interactions between parts” (DeLanda, 2006: 5).
* Items are reconfigurable, exist on their own and aren't restricted to one category
* 'curation is often associated with some form of value creation. ' - can't just be a collection, can't be made by AI
* experiential value !!!! Or social value or analytical value -> economic value
* “curatorial labor” (Scolere and Humphreys, 2016). Of course, there is no clear boundary between users who consume social media content and those who produce it. Many people who interact with social media are “prosumers” (Ritzer and Jurgenson, 2010) and participate in both practices simultaneously.
* content creators as a particularly influential group in any curatorial assemblage (Carah, 2014; Davis, 2017: 772–773) because they engage in practices of creating and selecting, of editing and contextualizing, of sharing and making visible, and of embedding and circulating social media content.
