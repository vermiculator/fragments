## Notes

* no cars - mass public transport and last-mile transport
* need for better local waste triage
  * reduce mental load on the consumer, 'out of your hands' with an actual guarantee of sustainable reuse and recycling
    * but also more direct, in-community waste management with consumer involvement as service for community
* more public toilets, accessible and public use
* similar small public conveniences
* smart grids for mass energy management, but also provision for self-managed isolated energy production
