* a form of curation, adjacent to remix, a kind of collage of screenshots from across the Web, like a mood board or vision board
* a largely 'feminine' form of communication, 'inalienable queerness'
* usually used for inspirational quotes, or as a form of poetry, or similar
* but is actually an advanced mechanism of pulling together disparate parts of the internet that connect by theme
* using screenshot technology you have a mechanism that is very accessible and surprisingly archival even though a lot of data is lost the meaning often remains. (image ids and alt text really helps with this)
