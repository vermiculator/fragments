## Mentions

* "pervasively operating mechanisms of capture and archiving and that the boundary between voluntary and involuntary forms of those has become ever more questionable today."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jye2eqpmr9bxekrb4jxyt764)
* "Developed in 1994 by Netscape programmers, cookies introduced what I would call a mnemotechnological layer to online surfing which, until then, had been characterized by a lack of pervasive capture and traceability as we know it today (Shah and Kesan, 2004). [(Smolicki, 2017)](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture#block-4b2745)
* "Cookies fundamentally altered the nature of surfing the Web from being a relatively anonymous activity, like wandering the streets of a large city, to the kind of environment where records of one’s transactions, movements and even desires could be stored, sorted, mined and sold. (Schwartz, 2001, no pagination)."  [(Smolicki, 2017)](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture#block-4b2745)
* technical solutions to automated capture - browsers/settings/plugins
  * "there are activist organizations that address involuntary exposure to capture and archiving by attempting to develop various kinds of technical solutions. A tool such as Tor – volunteer-operated servers"  [(Smolicki, 2017)](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture#block-adf16e)
