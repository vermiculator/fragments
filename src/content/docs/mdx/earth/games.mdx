* actions, rules, goals, objects
* used to achieve goal
* defining feature as goal?
* simulation?
* players as operators and agents
* players must consent to consistently agreed upon rules - this is negotiation of a shared entity, a shared space, a shared goal
* second-order design - designers don't create the final experience directly but craft systems and mechanics that allow players to generate their own experiences - eg consider the game types possible in GTA, or LARPing
* scaffolding an experience
* my actions cause meaningful impact, agency and control
* bending or disrupting a game
* curiosity
* space of possibility
* the illusion of agency, funnelling down a path
* game state, state machines
* be open to what a game state can be
* constraints on a game, phrased this way rather than rules as rules seem authoritarian/dominating/impose hierarchy but constraints just imply clear boundaries
* is pinball a game?
* direct action
* learning the wrong things
  \* mini motorway and segregation
  \* staying alive in turbulent times - but as the dictator
* factor.io multiplayer, nice
* 'win by doing nothing' is this a win?
* dance/martial arts/improv, physical games.
* interface feedback - visceral feedback - can feel visceral if you are embodying the avatar well enough - e-sex and VR, distance orgasm
* '4D' visualisations, cinema extra sensory experiences
* the eye contact between human and goose - release you from 'existential dullness' just by opportunity of becoming a goose
* toys and materiality of play
