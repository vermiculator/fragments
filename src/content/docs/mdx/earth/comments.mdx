## Notes

* who is the 'comments section' *for*?
  * the person who posts or the people who comment? is it really a dialogue?
* how different platforms and different users on those platforms take different approaches
* globalisation, translation, multi-language comment sections
* comments as joke platforms, text-based memes, stock responses to feel a part of something
* 'i want this' linking to [cognitive capitalism](/mdx/earth/cognitive-capitalism)
* commenting just to support, boost, play to algorithms
* value in public discussion, re-readability, education, vs personal value to poster, vs developmental growth of commentary
* pinned comments, OP response, continued discussion
* 'link me to this when x' functioning as community reminder as in TODO
* youtube comments culture and its evolution
  * anon hate, trolls
  * vague/general praise, love and support
  * specific personal connections
  * timestamped quotes with or without added commentary
  * timestamped breakdowns in livestream VOD type content
* tiktok comment culture and its wild differences
  * the more niche the content, the more personal the conversation
  * channels of reposted content or audience of non-native speakers often address the content like an in-joke with other viewers, often particularly incredulous or insulting
  * 'i get that but please see my pinned comment about not wanting to hear any more justification'
  * this content is for adults, for black ppl, for autistics etc
  * do NOT comment X y z (hyperspecific)
  * 'no trauma dumping in the comments'
  * more explicit posting
    * I'm not looking for a response
    * I want response from X y and z
    * Any response welcome
* "as a…" commenting
* see comment focused tools eg disqus
