* best method I've found thus far is in keeping a [commonplace book](/mdx/earth/commonplace-books)
* learning strategies differ for fact-books and experience-books, narratives
* novels are written for experience-based knowledge, transport you into a characters shoes to uncover a story to learn morally and through absorption you get critical analysis. immersion first, the insights come at the end.
* as with our own narratives, [lived forwards, understood backwards](/mdx/lived-forwards-understood-backwards)
* quick-note the aha moments
* how did it transform me, change my thinking, resonate with me. what touched me.
* don't look for overarching themes until afterwards
* learning through sympathy rather than detached logical analysis
