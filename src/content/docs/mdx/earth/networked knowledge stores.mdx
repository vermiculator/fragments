* how to follow other [digital gardens](/mdx/earth/digital-gardens)?
* feeds, rss etc
* but many are self-built with unique structures/updates may not be formatted well
* ideally properly *connecting* to the other gardens.
* linked graphs, [knowledge sharing](/mdx/earth/collaborative-knowledge), [knowledge lineage](/mdx/earth/knowledge-lineage)
* obviously many attempted solutions at this problem in this niche research area and in tech but still so much [siloing](/mdx/earth/platforms-and-silos). [Anytype](https://anytype.io/) is the most bold in its promises to manage this iirc
* block protocol?
* i have my own ideas on production of an ecosystem, but what's needed most is better [interoperability](/mdx/earth/interoperability) between various experiments
* there are definitely measures here i'm forgetting!
