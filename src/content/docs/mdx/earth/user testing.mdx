Methods

* Focus groups - qualitative feedback on major milestones or during pre-production
* Surveys - quantitative feedback, make sure it's not too long
* 1:1  Interviews - deeper insight and body language, but more hands-on

***

* max once a month, general surveys, plus short focused session for particular features
* as many people as possible, but separate those in your target audience and those not
* compensation, incentive?

***

* use non-leading questions
* explain acronyms and industry jargon
* start with general questions and ask more specific follow ups to break up the Q\&A
* how might people use certain features or accomplish certain tasks
* look for the friction points in user flows
