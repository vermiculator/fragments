* The clothes I can afford aren't made with quality and endurance in mind. They're built cheaply (with cheap labour) and they wear in high friction areas. Fast fashion is the only option for low-income people, but [poor quality keeps people poor](/mdx/earth/poor-quality-keeps-people-poor)
* Sizing (especially in women's clothing) is notoriously inconsistent and inaccurate.
* Clothes aren't built for disabled adults.
* Clothes aren't built for bigger bodies.
* Clothes aren't built for trans bodies.
* Clothes aren't built with sensory needs in mind.
* skill, resource, time, support issues with diy
* modern women's pockets as compared to historical equivalents
* my numerous personal problems with trousers in particular - pockets, ankles, thighs, butt, stomach, fabrics, movement
