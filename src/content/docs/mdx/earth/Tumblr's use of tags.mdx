1. as in general social media use, loosely in a semi-public, emergent or peer-induced manner, for wider reach or some vague sense of organisation
2. for very specific and personal indexing methods ([personomies](/mdx/earth/personomies))
3. for commentary ([tags as content](/mdx/earth/tags-are-sometimes-content))

for more discussion on nuances in general usage see ['altruistic' vs 'selfish' tagging aims](/mdx/earth/altruistic-vs-selfish-tagging-aims)

the second usage is uncommon on social media generally but more common to [Web 1.0](/mdx/earth/web-10), [social bookmarking](/mdx/earth/shared-digital-resources), earlier file-sharing, personal custom setups, and is of interest to library/archival studies

the third usage is very uncommon, if not largely unique to Tumblr
