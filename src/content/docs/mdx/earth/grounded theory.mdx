* a family of approaches developed in sociology as a response to hypothesis-first research models - Glaser and Strauss
* instead of starting with a theory, you can do field work and generate ground up inductive hypothesis from the collected data
* saturating the questions as you engage with data, develop concepts from micro to macro
* construct a model as it emerges from the data
* interpreting patterns and meaning
* justifiable as by reference to the data
* explanatory, not just descriptive
* is it even possible to not confirm to existing models and ideas you have
* constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006;2014) - emphasises that data and theory are co-constructed by researcher and participant - not fixed truths, interpretative, situated representations of experience
* data collection and analysis in parallel, see emerging patterns
* developing conceptual categories for theory building
* theoretical sampling - decisions on who and what to study are guided by developing theories
* use of multiple data types - elicited and non-elicited data
* don't look to confirm assumptions but allow the data to speak
* line-by-line coding - each time you engage you do sense-making
  * what process is described or enacted, how is that defined by the participant
  * what actions and strategies are taking place
  * how you listen to the data may change
  * how is the participant  claiming to thinking and feeling throughout - but remember inaccessibility of our own narratives, life as lived, narrative always evolving
  * shifts or turning points where the process changes
  * outcomes and effects of the process
* active listening, active witnessing, finding the complexities without assigning meaning based on assumption
* begin writing memos early that reflect recurring codes, early observations
* memos as a thinking space - short analytical notes, questions that arise
* relations - sequence, hierarchy, interaction
* you keep collecting until the data isn't revealing any more theories
* show and share data to justify each theory or category, explain how they connect, create structure around what they reveal
* final theories often communicated in everyday language, not too expert-specific
* theories can be tested later with other methods
