optimisation not in the [capitalist](/mdx/earth/anticapitalism) efficiency sense but optimising for well-being, ecosystem balance, social harmony, etc

eg emphasising simplification of visuals and functions and language to serve a less literate population rather than focusing on optimising the technical setup or a cost/privacy trade-off
