screenshots are a common method of content collection due to:

* ease, few actions required
* comparable methods across devices (usually a single click or physical button)
* compatibility of tools across applications
* portability of image data types
* human readability of data
* [refinding is quicker from images than text](/mdx/earth/refinding-is-quicker-from-images-than-text)
  but:
* image-only screenshots in circulation have often lost important metadata
* manipulated screenshots, unfaithful reproduction
* [lost context](/mdx/earth/screenshots-can-contain-extra-context)
* establishing a new form of data rather than a continuation
* separate instances remain unlinked
* even 'search by image' isn't particularly effective
