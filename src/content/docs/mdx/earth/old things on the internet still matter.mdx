* how old content is more dismissible on the internet
* sometimes rightly eg 'This scientific article is 7 years old and the information may no longer be accurate'
* sometimes arguably less rightly eg on music/performance youtube content 'how do i like this thing that is 11 years old', 'when this was made iphones weren't even out'
* links to general discussions of 'of its time' and content in timely context, but more vital now there's so much internet content in addition to the traditional media forms
* links to dismissal of old things due to 'irrelevance' and things that are 'timeless' or more cross-time relatable
* links to ageism, and particularly the kind faced by eg middle aged women who become 'invisible'
* resurfaceability, algorithmic choice to surface backlog eg certain old youtube videos 'doing the rounds' again
* archiving work, resharing archived work via new medium eg article archive newsletters
* standing by/dismissing old opinions, feelings towards old work, artists and old work
* disclaiming and apology, eg privatised youtube channels
* re-evaluating old content - on a personal level, on an institutional or organisational scale
* which 'opinions' you put your name to, 'opinion of individual journalist does not reflect us' etc
* how long any opinion shared can be said to last
* quicker turnaround of opinions in young people/developmental periods
* the opinions we hold more firmly and more loosely
