* The internet now as a representative of mass culture, a conglomeration of special interest areas and personally curated feeds of more and less ubiquity
* Popular culture now looks like what?
* 'Relatable' content based more or less on certain lifestyles
* The concept of 'viral' in the early years meaning everyone internet connected saw it, vs now.
* The power of cookies, stored data, analytics, targeted advertising forming not a mass hive mind of indoctrination but actually specialising and specifying people into isolation.
* Mass control of content by corporations use to over generalise which isolated outsiders but now it bands outsiders together, which can be both beneficial and harmful
* Incredibly specialized niches in reddit forums and other special-purpose sites and forums
* Locality/community? Community Facebook pages and Marketplace, 'Nextdoor' type apps
* community guidelines
* parasocial relationships
* personal branding, aliases, avatars, multi-identity, relatability
* cultural exchange
