## Mentions

* "**To oppose something is to maintain it.** They say here "all roads to Mishnory". To be sure, if you turn back on Mishnory and walk away from it, you are still on the Mishnory road. To oppose vulgarity is inevitable to be vulgar. You must go somewhere else; you must have another goal; then you walk a different road." - The Left Hand of Darkness, Ursula Le Guin
