* ### Notes
* Urban design for [public tech](/mdx/earth/public-tech)
* Modular urban design for  community-built functional spaces and infrastructures
  * Swaps, shares, resource storage
  * Public workspaces
  * Public machinery, processing and recycling
* Reclaiming tiny bits of land/grass verges to grow free food = many people do this but how to coordinate better, assist the process and use even smaller spaces and more widely
* Public places built in one time with some set of social expectations, and then how they are repurposed in a modern age with other tech, other social rules, other people priorities etc
  * Retaining archival/historical relevance whilst using for people now
  * how much do we owe to past and future generations?
  * When spaces make demands of us it is mostly the ghosts of people building with intention and desire and you not filling the space in the way you think they intended or in the way you associate with the building
