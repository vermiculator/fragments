Necessary shifts in economics and political structures may come with costs that are frequent talking points for detractors. Commonly there are actually simple, ecological and humanistic answers to these problems. It is essential that transitions are thoughtful and considerate of a wide range of demands, providing justice for everyone involved.

* clearest example: green transitions commonly argued against due to loss of jobs in traditional heavy/fuel industries eg oil, coal, steel.
* in a just, green transition, these issues are a primary factor, intertwined with the move to cleaner fuels, rather than an afterthought
* eg re-education, compensation, funding of green projects that produce jobs, reducing numbers of works gradually.
* bringing everyone together into a greener future, not leaving people behind.
