* coming to identify with an online/virtual avatar
* noted academically in earlier 'avatar' styles of the 2000s (think: second life)
* but becoming increasingly relevant with more realism, personality and emotional connection in video games, as well as VTubers and similar '[puppeteered](/mdx/puppetry-and-animation)' avatars
* will be interesting to see how this evolves with more AI generated avatars (think: those profile pictures of historical setting/outfit with your face)
* seeded by [ai generated influencers.mp4](</mdx/ai generated influencers.mp4>)
