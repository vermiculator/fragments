* How technical people can get so interested in a certain technology, or money spent, sunk cost fallacy, prioritisation of 'innovation' over experimentation and iteration with actual feedback, that they deprioritise low tech with big impact on non technical people, getting technical solutions of yesteryear in the hands of people who can really benefit, and considering the ethics of unbridled 'growth' (seeded by Answer in Progress [YT video](https://youtu.be/r1N81RRQ4ec) on The entire history of the YouTube algorithm)
