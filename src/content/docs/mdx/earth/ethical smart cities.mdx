## Notes

* radically private smart cities/public tech actually for the public/bottom up smart cities
* ​Prioritise the human impact over technological methodology - low tech by default, no tech where appropriate, high tech where necessary - reducing environmental impact
* book: smart citizens not smart cities
* bottom up
* ethics of 'Pervasive informatics'
* open industry standards
* accessible within low-tech context
* Public citizen interfaces to energy, waste systems, civic data, etc
* no predictive policing or similar
* Actually given the option whether to share your data
* Avoid using aggregate data to form analytics on who uses what, anonymous, for the service of the people, not for nations or businesses
* distributed, federated, opt-in data collection direct public access to data
* smart infrastructure with real time data without falling into surveillance territory
* Monitoring useful things not business applicable things
*
