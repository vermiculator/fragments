## The Concept

There are many loose rules for building software that is generally useable, allowing your users to achieve their goals without frustration, data loss, inaccuracies, etc. Here are some I've found useful.

* [usability](/mdx/earth/usability)
* [accessibility](accessibility.md)

## Notes

### Nilsen's 10 Heuristics (1990)

* Visibility of system status
* Match between system and the real world
* User control and freedom
* Consistency and standards
* Error prevention
* Recognition rather than recall
* Flexibility and efficiency of use
* Aesthetic and minimalist design
* Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
* Help and documentation

### Schneiderman’s 8 “Golden Rules” (1987)

* Strive for consistency
* Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
* Cater to universal [usability](/mdx/earth/usability)
* Offer informative feedback
* Design dialog to yield closure
* Offer simple error handling
* Prevent errors
* Permit easy reversal of actions
* Support internal locus of control
* Reduce short-term memory load

### Tog’s First Principles (1978, revised 2014)
