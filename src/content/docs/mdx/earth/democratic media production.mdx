* "Although there is a certain implicit recognition of a performative side to media, it does not have to do much with the agency of the media as objects, technologies or technical infrastructures, but rather agency of people who happen to control media institutions and distribution of media texts."  \[⤴️]\([https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0psnhw7wsx39z87gkf9h1kr](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0psnhw7wsx39z87gkf9h1kr)
* "a certain divide between those who get to produce and control the distribution and reception of media texts and the rest who is left to only consume them and among whom these effects can be subsequently monitored and measured."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0psphevddxqvfbrmeb9e9p0)
* "Stiegler perceives democratization of power and opening of participation in media production (which were absent from such previous media milieux as TV and radio) as crucial forces to restore a chance to liberate “hypomnesic memory from its industrial function” (2010, p.85)."
