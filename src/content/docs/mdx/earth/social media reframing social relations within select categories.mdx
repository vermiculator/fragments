Self-described relations restricted by data options or available interfacing methods. An instance of [data so imprecise that it is inaccurate](/mdx/earth/data-so-imprecise-that-it-is-inaccurate) and [losing data through analogue-to-digital conversion](/mdx/earth/digitising-the-analogue-means-data-loss)

### Notes

* social media reframing social relations within select categories
* early on, as 'friend' and 'follower'
* then more extensively through eg fb familial relations and relationship statuses
* to later eg snapchat/bereal/etc with close friend groups and streak partners
* more generally with parasocial relationships now incredibly common
* will machine learning soon by used to define relationships?
  * it is likely already used in eg determining human networks for marketing, surveillance, etc
  * life simulation games that generate relationships on the basis of interactions
    * eg The Sims 4 appears to have a complex relationship system, will check the code/docs
