## The Concept

Even open source advocates often put up paywalls because they're still forced to exist under capitalism. That sucks for both them and the users, and slows the momentum of the movement.

## Notes

* developers need income
* people don't fund open source and genuinely helpful software as there's no profit
* so developers have to put paywalls up against the people they could/want to help the most
* 'freemium' etc
