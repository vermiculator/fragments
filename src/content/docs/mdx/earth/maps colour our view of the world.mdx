## The Concept

From human scale it is difficult to capture a complete view of the world physically. We conceptualise it based on representations, and so maps yield a disproportionate influence on how we conceptualise national borders, politics and geographies.

## Notes

* cartographers hold a surprisingly huge amount of power
* by extension, the tech companies who now are the main source of maps
* projections
* centering different nations
* prioritising malling certain locations eg Google street view disparity
* prioritising collecting certain kinds of data, not utilising public local knowledge, or revealing private local knowledge past its usual bounds, etc
* we are unable to conceptualise the whole earth as it is so any representation essentially becomes it
* political boundaries made more concrete by mapping, and natural boundaries de-emphasised
* whoever makes the map makes the world
* indigenous knowledge, colonialism, erasing meaning and names and local identities, crushing all power and authority of indigenous people
* find an American map with indigenous groupings
