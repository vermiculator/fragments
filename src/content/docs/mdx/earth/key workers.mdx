Covid's designation of 'key workers', how this both reveals essential functions in an organisation and superfluous work but also what is genuinely crucial to a society but then also often what was crucial to capitalism (eg the focus on opening shops for the sake of the national economy rather than for the employees, and how furlough must've altered some peoples perspectives of what they want to be doing and if just being paid anyway is better). I personally don't even know anyone who was furloughed as they all either were essential workers or moved to WFH
