## Mentions

* "Foucault describes the formation of an ethical and moral approach to life in terms of a generative absorption and assimilation of other, diverse opinions, observations, and thoughts, as opposed to an uncritical compliance with some universal set of rules:"
  * " \[W]hatever we have absorbed should not be allowed to remain unchanged, or it will be no part of us. We must digest it; otherwise it will merely enter the memory and not the reasoning power" (Foucault, 1997, p.213, cited in [Smolicki, 2017](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture))
