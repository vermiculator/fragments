most 'pages' here are mostly empty. i create them as links from other pages, or because i know its a concept i refer to frequently, or that i have resources i'd 'tag' with that phrase, or this is a 'seed' to plant or a 'thread' to pull, or just generally a standalone [atomic](/mdx/earth/what-counts-as-an-atomic-fragment) fragment

***

this is partly due to legacy systems, partly by whim, partly by choice. in the future the interface and routing mechanisms will [better respect when links are more important than content](/mdx/earth/there-is-no-primary-data-type). for now, there may just be a lot that seems empty.

it is often an external cue for something in my brain or in the world to which i want to refer without attempting to rewrite every thought i've ever had.

***

there are more concrete theory-based justifications also - external mnemonic traces are useful despite their partiality, [redlinks are important](/mdx/earth/redlinks-are-important), [digital gardens are never 'finished'](/mdx/earth/digital-gardens-are-never-finished) and [naturalistic data is messy](/mdx/earth/messy-data)
