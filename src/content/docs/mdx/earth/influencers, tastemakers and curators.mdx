* The need has arisen again for internet curation, as in the early days with sites of relevance or interest, it becomes necessary to 'curate' your own feeds, train your algorithms, or follow 'content creators' who you trust to produce what you're after. This way, we are back to the cults of personality. Internet representatives who are influencing on your behalf.
* with mass-saturation of 'content' we now become hoarders and scavengers of good material, with ad-hoc libraries and archives of varying niche and varying quality held by all sorts of people
* the personal and the professional, competing personas, liability of mis/disinformation
