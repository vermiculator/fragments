## Notes

* Discoverability of 'content' and topic linking
* Inspirations, direct source, op, citation and making the route through a thought process / across the Internet more explicit.
* product/service discoverability prioritised over thought/idea/movement (and even that still inadequate due to competition of sellers over customer need)
* fostering collaboration, sharing methods and processes, encouraging peer review and replication whilst reducing redundant labour
