## Mentions

* "Synthesising monotropic theory with deep ecology and holistic anatomy, we have found a multi-dimensional, spacious, edgeless terrain under the monotropism map. We are calling it *holotropism*" [(1)](/mdx/library/life-is-at-bottom-diversity#block-003601)
* "Holotropic people have naturally wide open sensory gates. To participate in/as the immense world without becoming overwhelmed, we holotropes have two central methods: *in*, by hyperfocusing our attention on one sensory or cognitive path, and *as*, through synthesising our experience into coherence." [(1)](/mdx/library/life-is-at-bottom-diversity#block-d02c54)
* "While autistic people are not the only ones capable of absorption, it is the signature of a holotropic life"  [(1)](/mdx/library/life-is-at-bottom-diversity#block-2f569a)
* "While it has been given little consideration in autism studies, embodied coherence is arguably our true gift, that we can both receive and give. When we are able to abide in receptive open awareness, we find we are wholeness itself." [(1)](/mdx/library/life-is-at-bottom-diversity#block-3a134c)
