* on the possible problems with counter mapping and then what it can achieve despite the problems (Simpson, 2017)
* Digital technologies are providing new avenues of 'extra-activism', (Kidd, ) in transmedia mapping, narrative and protest, described by Marisa Duarte (2017, p) as an "orchestrated assemblages" of devices, platforms, and messaging. These decentralised networks give a technological basis from which to destabilise modern colonialist efforts.
* " demonstrate how counter-mapping by itself, as with any genre of data justice, can never be substituted for long term political organizing (Concepción, 2014). They demonstrate the importance of Indigenous control of data, a trans-media approach that builds on all the extant cultural and communications resources and ways of knowing of a particular group or movement. Echoing what MIT professor and data activist Sasha Costanza-Chock said at the Data Justice conference, they provide examples of data activism fused within larger projects of redistributive, transformative and restorative justice, which optimize their liberation and not the capitalist market (Costanza-Chock, 2018)."
* direct-to-digital countermapping 'Such processes are able to represent ‘complex, fuzzy, or multi attribute data’ that extend beyond Cartesian-based spatial representations of knowledge (Elwood, 2006, p. 696).'
