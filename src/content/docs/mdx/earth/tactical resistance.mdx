## Mentions

* "It refuses to be associated with “liberatory,” “progressive,” or “heroic” actions against the strategic. Nor is it an attempt to completely withdraw and stay allegedly unaffected by it."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3rhfetbcvxj49p5dm2b7rnp)
* "the tactical might be aligned with the notion of resistance, understood not as an intensification of an effort to counteract, but as a voluntary limitation of commitment to directly combat the hegemonic force, and a subsequent redirection of effort, energy, and passion toward something else"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3rhfz5350pd8hy89qdcjrvf)
