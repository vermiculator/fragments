* contranyms
* semantic bleaching and semantic strengthening
* 'Depends on what is is' on language predicates -- complements needed way more - this is why I and other autistic ppl like me ask so many qs for clarification when it's possible to do so
* double negation in spoken language, or conflicting yes/no with different emphasis having different meanings with regional dialect.
* eg 'no yeah' = yes, 'yeah no' = no, 'yeah no for sure' = definitely
* 'the Cherokee language has a verb tense that specifically notes the exclusion of a person in the conversation, 'we're going (but not you)' --- ' this is called "clusivity" and its found in a bunch of languages, including Chechen, Vietnamese, Samoan and Quechua" -- find more sources on this -- links to in The Art of Gathering the discussion of explicitly defining who isn't invited as well as who is, in order to have defined purpose in gathering
* * all those unknown etymological roots eg milk or be milked, etymologists still don't agree on which came first, the verb or the noun
* wherewithal
* club and club - to club together, a club is a stick with clump of stuff on end. Togetherness, 'collect middle' direct translation of 'focus/concentration' in Japanese
* indentured and dentures - indent/notch/dent - tooth - zigzag - cut contract paper
* language evidentiality, language where you can't say a fact without saying where you for the information i.e. implied, hearsay etc/I heard that/It is obvious that/It seems that
* language affecting outlook, we make language and language makes us
* words and concepts often used casually as synonymous, but where the distinction can be important in certain context or all the time
* Words not having meaning intrinsically but usage, which differs with context
* constant evolution
* a **heterological word**, does not apply to itself.
* [sound symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_symbolism) is the perceptual similarity between speech sounds and concept meanings. It is a form of [linguistic iconicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconicity "Iconicity")
* other pronouns eg first person dead, used only in suicide notes
