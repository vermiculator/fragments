* silhouettes obscuring, silhouettes revealing shape
* do they actually provide anonymity
* shadow and form, hiding detail, resolution
* like how in photo licensing you don't need model releases if subject isn't identifiable, silhouettes are measured by detail
* some people's silhouettes are more recognisable than others
