* email (eg SMTP) is the introductory example -- the federated structure is why eg @outlook can communicate with @gmail
* ActivityPub is a common used protocol for federated networks in the fediverse

***

* each time a dominating silo platform goes down or goes bust or makes unpopular changes there is a new wave of switching to fediverse alternatives, interestingly the decline of [Twitter](/mdx/entities/twitter) enabled actually usable and widely adopted alternatives
  * this is still split between those that will and won't federate amongst each other - both due to [big tech](/mdx/earth/big-tech) ownership / [commercial](/mdx/earth/anticonsumerism) aims and to the rejection of these aims, ironically(?)
  * Bluesky, Threads and Mastodon are all now widely used Twitter-likes
  * I don't find the scrolling-feed text-based [micro-blogging](/mdx/earth/micro-content) format necessarily the most conducive to [pluriversal](/mdx/earth/pluriversality) discourse or multifaceted, hyperconnective, nuanced sharing of experiences, so haven't approached any of these platforms with much interest, but see that those with certain communicative styles take to it well. I'd rather be able to center any form of data as the primary discussion point and not prioritise (as is built into image-based or text-based platforms, even those that do allow for additional content)
