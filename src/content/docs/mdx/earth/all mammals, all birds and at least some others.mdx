* theories of consciousness are frequently updating to include more kinds of creatures
* it is scientific consensus (source needed) that at least all mammals, all birds and at least some other kinds of creatures (such as octopuses) do have consciousness.
* [check up on science, it's always updating](/mdx/earth/science-is-all-theories) and there is a high likelihood given human experience/[folk psychology](/mdx/earth/folk-psychology)/philosophy/other [frameworks of understanding](/mdx/earth/frameworks-of-understanding)/etc that all creatures including invertebrates are indeed equally sentient/sapient/conscious/soulful
* markers of supposed difference that are repeatedly broken down - "language, tool use, social behaviour, mental events" [➡](/mdx/library/simians-cyborgs-and-women---the-reinvention-of-nature#block-ac7963)
