* is there room for creativity in access, does it depend on the importance of the information communicated, as in with info/warning for general purpose in other media

* meaning and expression in media

* dynamic subtitles

* ive seen inadequate audio commentary and jokes in subtitles that hamper the accessibility

* but also room for FUN in life, especially for disabled people writing for disabled people

* interpretation is also a social activity, has all the same interpersonal considerations as other forms of communication

* found a project that plays with this [https://laurelschwulst.com/e/alt-text-as-poetry/](https://laurelschwulst.com/e/alt-text-as-poetry/)

* when my dad reads out subtitles from TV for my mum (eye problems), he sometimes censors ([disabled people can swear](/mdx/earth/disabled-people-are-often-infantilised#block-458322)) and sometimes adds in lines, re-edits for clarity ([what should we interpret?](/mdx/what-should-we-interpret)) but also makes changes in pursuit of puns, wordplay and humour. I find this interesting and don't know where i stand, if I'm there I'll also give her the uninterpreted version (although obviously its already through a translated filter) so she gets both the information and the playful experience.

* to look for research or more creative explorations in this vein!
