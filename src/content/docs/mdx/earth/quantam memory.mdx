* degradation of memory on recall is reminiscent of the observer effect from quantam physics (?) - the feelings/effect of the event live on and become a part of processing (behave in a way) until an attempt is made to recall the specifics of the memory (it is measured) and the resulting memory is remembering your last remembering as the recall process degraded it (changed on observation)  ??
