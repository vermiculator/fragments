* on doing research with people considered 'unable to consent'
* eg children, adults with learning disabilities, etc
* seeking assent, behavioural cues etc
* i find this interesting in that so much of what we do is based on consent, assent, dissent
* who is considered unable to consent and why
* how to approach inquiry in these situations

seeded by some research ethics clips from Dr Pratap Rughani and Dr Alison Clarke
