* thinking on (observed, possible) likelihood to trust things on internet more than general information
* maybe its not the medium but the record of it - maybe as it is more persistent than their experience of it
  * eg written word appearing to hold more weight than spoken word
  * very culturally variable
  * not sure why the persistence changes things
  * spoken conversation being recorded shouldn't make the words hold more weight but somehow it does
  * keeping a written or filmed record solidifies something not entirely, but better than (most) human memories can
  * would be interesting to explore kinds of records that degrade at similar rates and dissimilar rates to human memories, and compare factors that impact that degradation in comparison with what impacts degradation of human memories
* [de\~colonialism](/mdx/earth/decolonialism) +[white supremacy](/mdx/earth/whiteness)  and the importance of [oral history](/mdx/earth/oral-history) globally, especially in [indigenous populations](/mdx/earth/indigenous-perspectives)
