* eg as applies to less-than-ethical research with eg indigenous communities
* but also as applies to users of [Web 2.0](/mdx/earth/web-20) services and platforms, digital forms of data, [hidden data flows](/mdx/earth/hidden-data-flows) and [data exhaust](/mdx/earth/data-exhaust), the 'extraction imperative' that sees wasted opportunity in possibilities for data collection to be sold on to train predictive models ([AI ethics](/mdx/earth/ai))
