* faceless manufacturing

* obfuscated production chains

* lack of transparency in company ethics, in suppliers and manufacturing standards

* ethics as marketing and employee attraction, comprehensive value guides not actually enacted at any level

* huge ethical supply problems eg blood trades and enslavement that still go on

* small pushbacks
  * 'inside the factory'
  * LUSH employees have individual labels with illustrated portrait to sign off on their work
    * but how can you attach an entire chain of production this way? everyone involved at every level? how far back and how wide can you realistically go?
