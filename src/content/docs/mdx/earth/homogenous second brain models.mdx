## Mentions

* Smolicki problematizes the haunting canon of the Memex as fitting new technologies onto its metaphor 'tends to conflate the dynamics of (human) memory with that of (technological) storage' and 'reproduces\[s] the logic of progressivism' [(Smolicki, 2017)](/mdx/library/para-archives---rethinking-personal-archiving-practices-in-the-times-of-capture-culture#block-dbe766)
