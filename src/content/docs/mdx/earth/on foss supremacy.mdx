Holding FOSS as an ideal is not incompatible with respecting the pervasiveness of non-FOSS tech. There are those who are foss-or-nothing, which is fine on an individual/niche community basis, but wider communities will prioritise whatever is [usable](/mdx/earth/usability) and [accessible](/mdx/earth/accessibility), or [whatever they already understand](/mdx/earth/tech-inertia), or whatever has a nice interface. The ethos of transparency, tech freedoms and open access is more important than idolising specific stacks, specifications, infrastructures or organisations.

* "While I care very much about “free software” (the name is confusing, it refers to freedom rather than price), I don’t share the same perspective as most “fossbros” and organizations like the FSF. Software freedom is important because it gives people agency instead of delegating control to an authority; it’s not valuable in and of itself, and promoting a “FOSS” alternative that has vulnerabilities and accessibility issues is sometimes counterproductive. I think that simply meeting GNU’s definition of free software isn’t enough: it’s one of multiple requirements for software to avoid the possibility of user domestication." - [seirdy](/mdx/entities/seirdy)
