## The Concept

Legacy systems store gender in binary terms. [Gender](/mdx/earth/gender-diversity) is not, and never has been, restricted to 'M/F'.

## Notes

* M/F/Prefer not to say
  * still inadequate and oppressive, assumes gender variance is reticence to 'reveal' some 'true' gender
* M/F/Other/Prefer not to say
  * just about adequate
  * But if you ACTUALLY need gender data (hint: [you probably don't](/mdx/earth/you-nearly-never-need-to-know-a-users-gender-actually)), why would you arbitrarily limit the precision of data
    \- Especially on so-called 'diversity monitoring' forms
    \- If 'Other' is used, strong suggestion of multi-selection and self-description

## Mentions

* "defining the gender category with a binary value has already introduced bias into the system." [➡](/mdx/library/how-ai-image-generators-make-bias-worse)
