* ## Resources
* [Debt - The First 500 Years](/mdx/library/debt---the-first-500-years)
*
* ## Theory
* TODO
* gift economy and its transitional forms
* community owned and mutual aid vs state run
* universal basic income
* Shared resources in communal housing
* ### Historical Examples
* notes here soon
* ### Fictional Examples
* notes here soon
* ### Extant Examples
  * libraries. services and resources free, community/locally managed
  * libraries of things (some are transitional/currently for-profit and some are existing gift economies )
  * Peer-to-peer gifting eg Freecycle, streetside 'free stuff' for direct immediate pickup
  * farmer surplus, direct from production
  * sometimes public access to surplus from restaurants and supermarkets
  * Community larders, community fridge (sometimes literal)
  * Community-run free shops (not widespread but almost exactly the theoretical ideal)
* ### Transitional Concepts
* [supermarket subscriptions](/mdx/earth/supermarket-subscriptions) as a step to un-commodifying groceries and other basic supplies
* Peer-to-peer sales (often but not always brokered by middle-men) eg Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Gumtree, car boot sales and similar
* Charity shops (in UK culture at least), essentially mediated peer-to-peer selling with profits redirected
* Food banks as closest blueprint for free food for all
* ### Limiting Factors
* what prevents eg widespread community-run free shops? money + commitment + paperwork?
