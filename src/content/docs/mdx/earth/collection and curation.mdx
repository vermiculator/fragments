collecting a mass, by certain category or by quality but mostly indiscriminately, vs curating a collection from selected sources, tying items together, forming a cohesive narrative through them

it may be that collection is an action followed by curation, or that both go hand-in-hand

it may be that collection is a private activity and curation public-facing, or that collection is more free-for-all public and curation a private process.

many contexts by which people collect and curate things, and other animals also carry out these activities eg in nest-building
