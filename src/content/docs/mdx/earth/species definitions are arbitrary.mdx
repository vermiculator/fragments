* the whole taxonomy is fundamentally arbitrary, but still useful - based on handy indicators
  \- common genetic material
  \- common ancestry
  \- common behaviour
  \- common appearance
  \- common features and forms
  \- common environment?
* a fun example of this is the Scrotifera, whose commonality lies in their scrotums
* this view plants us more firmly into relation with the animals around us
