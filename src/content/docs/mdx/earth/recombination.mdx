in so many contexts that my notes here will be incredibly mixed up, which fits

***

* on remixing sources and resources

* citation, inspiration, reuse and composition

* ### Resources

twitter thread -> AI text use into a song -> viral on tiktok (on reuse and creativity and ownership and IP)

peoples of any kind will always remix, image of any kind will remix, etc. idk. Just thinking of how much disinformation is by obscuring context, thinking also of clickbait vids with cutout style thumbnails very blatantly obscuring context. When is 'fair use' actually fair use outside of the concept of copyright. What is the goal and intent of using these images
