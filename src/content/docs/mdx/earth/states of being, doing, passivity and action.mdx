* "The relationship between action and existence"- "Nietzsche’s quote, “to do is to be,” refers to the ideas of Socrates and Plato on the relationship between action and existence."
* "Socrates ​also said, “to do is to be. He believed that doing is equivalent to ​being and that taking action is the same as having a certain kind of existence."
* "Plato, on the other hand, believed that being is equivalent to doing"... then I got BLOCKED and never went back hahahaaaa (i am still interested in this ....)
