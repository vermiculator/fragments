* para-archive - "A long-term commitment to a parallel record of selected subsets of everyday life,"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3s71hgehs4p4ns61ea641g6)
* "a construct, to a large extent inspired by a blend of Stiegler’s philosophy of technology and de Certeau’s interest in the evasiveness of the everyday as a terrain rich in what Ben Highmore calls “para-archives” (de Certeau, 1984; Highmore, 2006)"
* para-archival mindset - capturing with internal framework and beliefs - like capturing along themes and within your own guidelines
* "para-archiving, seen simultaneously as both a conceptual tool helping to problematize the dynamics and aesthetics of living with technologies and a creative media practice through which the individual’s position in relation to the inescapable context of capturing and archiving technologies, can be negotiated and inventively reconfigured, from within."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jye2pp1ptqb59m6wj3e2at3y)
* "the parallel nature of my practices in relation to other streams of my everyday life"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jye6ajf6szaxrv5zacxdxvde)
* * "\[...] as a para-archival device \[...] my use of the device at the moment was conditioned by the principles of my project in which I have been regularly reflecting on and documenting various aspects of the contemporary techno-culture and a condition of living in a computerized society. The para-archiving mode means that recording and archiving functionalities of the device become deliberately brought to the fore at the cost of all the other, more commonly known and habitual functions \[...] capturing and cataloging the captured happens deliberately besides, parallel or next to other habitual uses as well as other modalities of automated tracking and capture inherently embedded in today’s network technologies."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0prka6rpc3hrwwvyg3g09c5)
* para-archival "foregrounds people’s motivations, aspirations and goals that operationalize media technologies in a way that these might in return instigate more controllable and intended micro-effects"
* "I propose to see the empowering quality of para-archiving in it happening despite, aside from or in a soft insubordination to dominant norms, measures, and patterns.
* "a plurality of ways for apprehending the notion of archive and archiving"
* para-archival -- as a media practise where the capture and cataloguing is deliberately besides or parallel to the inbuilt logs and the standard habitual uses of the device. The device relies on its own mechanisms and motivations that differ from yours
* "create a backdrop for developing other, parallel, attentive modes of conceptualizing and performing personal archiving within the context of capture culture, in other words, a backdrop not to be counter-acted, but simply acted with, in parallel."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2ywa28m155j7hzhk7wxst24)
* "para-archiving can be said to operate through deliberate, material and performative interventions into the spatio-temporal conditions one occupies."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3s6ppm52qt5wy37j2jv9ac6)
* "parallel to (and thus not explicitly against) official, formal archival “abstractions” concerned with the production and management of qualified knowledge, scrutinized to serve scientific, exploitative, anthropological, or medical ends (Highmore, 2002, p.89)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3rk0nysdng9v8fnbv7585kz)
