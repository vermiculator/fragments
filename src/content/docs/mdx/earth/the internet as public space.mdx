* regulation on how content is consumed, sometimes requests sometimes demands

* setting boundaries for your own pages and profiles
  * taking lead on how you are treated and how you'd like to interact with the world
  * but personal pages on public platforms aren't actually personal, they're a shopfront
  * often unenforceable boundaries, left to other parties to respect or not, just like in offline world
  * muting, blocking, or leaving platforms as direct mechanisms for disapproval
  * mechanisms to report to authorities, just like in offline world
  * who does and who should be holding any authority over these matters

* 'community guidelines' in eg forums and discords that are legitimately community-informed and community-managed vs corporate 'community guidelines' that have frequent backlash by the users eg Instagram nipple policy

* [who is the comments section for?](comments.md)

* the right to be an enigma, public art and its consequences

* the right to ignorance of possible response, pre-caveats and disclaimers, fear of mis-speech preventing sharing anything - both on and offline

* the importance of making mistakes, and dealing with them well

* public forums for backlash, the ease of storing evidence of wrongdoing

* public safety, safeguarding, what we owe to each other, [online exploitation and consent](/mdx/earth/online-exploitation-and-consent)
  * 'if you don't like us maybe don't follow us or don't comment'
    'no, you don't get to say that. You're a public figure.'

* online culture as representative of offline culture to more or lesser extents

* how comments sections on some forums can be more strictly controlled for integrity of useful educational eg coding, stack overflow, 'this doesn't answer the question' sort of thing

* upvoting, downvoting, distributed mechanisms for approval

* QA forums, currency systems of social (or sometimes monetary) value, bulk answering without adding real value to discussion

* what about as physical space? [the internet as physical infrastructure](/mdx/earth/the-internet-as-physical-infrastructure)
