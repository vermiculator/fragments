Some things I try to keep consistent here, to keep the space more manageable and useful. Not comprehensive or strictly adhered to, just a guide that may be of interest as I add to it.

Elaborations since writing my [Masters thesis](/mdx/works/thesis/masters-thesis) are pending!

***

* write for yourself by default [Andy's working notes](/mdx/entities/andys-working-notes) -
* everything on this site needs a disclaimer of my personal context and informality of the notes - i write specific disclaimers only when it feels my allegiance is particularly ambiguous/need to clarify inclusion of certain topics or sources/etc
* I want to avoid [Snowclones](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Snowclones)  for the sake of readability, but sometimes I need to [lighten the mood](/mdx/earth/lighten-the-mood) for my own sake eg [it was Agatha all along](/mdx/earth/it-was-agatha-all-along)
* for true binaries/oppositional forces, make one article and use an alias for each opposite
* aliases are useful, use them often
* I use X as a general placeholder, despite [X, formerly known as Twitter](/mdx/earth/x-formerly-known-as-twitter) being frequently in the way
* loose hierarchies. parent/peer/relations don't necessarily match up or adhere to strict hierarchy, just provide useful links to adjacent notes
* titles are sometimes topic areas to explore, sometimes statements to discuss, sometimes [assertions](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zLhoRUyjKU665EY16u4XXJy), and sometimes [concept handles](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3b7sidNrEkNaY9qfGwZjwz)
