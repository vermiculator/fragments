* [personal site of a singular human author.](/mdx/earth/i)

* [i](/mdx/earth/i) am a cyber-creative: an artist, maker, technologist, developer, researcher, stranger, friend.

* this space is fluctuating and convergent. most pages are just an [index](/mdx/earth/index-of-potential) to a topic of interest

* my perspective, as any, is informed by my own experience, and will vary in pertinence, relevance and cohesion with your own. I encourage you to widen my sphere of understanding and interest if you approach with empathy - curiosity - communal motive.
