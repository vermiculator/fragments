there was an external source of an idea, framing or phrasing but I either never wrote it down or it got corrupted/deleted in one of my many [digital migrations](/mdx/earth/digital-migration)

hopefully i'll [refind](/mdx/earth/refinding) it at some point! let me know if you can fill a [gap](/mdx/earth/gaps-as-potential)!
