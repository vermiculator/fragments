## Extracts

* "I don’t share the same perspective as most “[fossbros](/mdx/earth/tech-bros)” and organizations like the FSF. Software freedom is important because it gives people agency instead of delegating control to an authority; it’s not valuable in and of itself, and promoting a “[fosssh](/mdx/earth/fosssh)” alternative that has vulnerabilities and [accessibility](/mdx/earth/a11y) issues is sometimes counterproductive." ^bb76a0
* "I think that simply meeting GNU’s definition of free software isn’t enough: it’s one of multiple requirements for software to avoid the possibility of [user domestication](/mdx/earth/user-domestication)."
