"You don't have to simulate a virtual world when the real world simulates itself."

***

I first found this in like 2018(?)
They've done so much more since ?!

Works with all of my ethos for [tangible interfaces](/mdx/earth/tangible-interfaces), [collaborative knowledge](/mdx/earth/collaborative-knowledge), [collective future-building](/mdx/earth/collective-future-building), open access, simple tools, [permacomputing](/mdx/earth/permacomputing), [low-power tech](/mdx/earth/low-power-tech), [low tech](/mdx/earth/low-tech), [analogue computing](/mdx/earth/analogue-computing), [visible mechanisms](/mdx/earth/visible-mechanisms), [recombination](/mdx/earth/recombination)

* completely [self-hosted](/mdx/earth/fosssh) and they work on it from within it

* [self-exemplifying media](/mdx/earth/self-exemplifying-media)

* looking to do a full deep-dive now my focus is so strongly back in this area
