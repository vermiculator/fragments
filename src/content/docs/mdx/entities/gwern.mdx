* 'automatic inflation-adjusted currency' on [https://gwern.net/index](https://gwern.net/index)
* " an ecosystem of “popup”/“popin” annotations & previews of links for frictionless browsing—the net effect of hierarchical structures with collapsing and instant popup access to excerpts enables iceberg-like pages where most information is hidden but the reader can easily drill down as deep as they wish
* 'demo of all features/stress-test page'
* "We may be able to do typography differently in the future with new technology, like VR/AR headsets which come with eye tracking technology intended for foveated rendering—forget simple tricks like emphasizing the beginning of the next line as the reader reaches the end of the current line, do we need ‘lines’ at all if we can do things like just-in-time display the next piece of text in-place to create an ‘infinite line’?" (design-graveyard)
* popins "we have a fast, flexible, debugged, good-looking system which we see no major flaws in, and future work will be focused on the content which goes into popups (such as by using machine learning to automatically write summaries)" (design-graveyard)
