## Instrumental and affective fragments

[[Critical Data Studies|Critical Data Studies (CDS)]] allows us to conceptualise [[data and information processing|data]] 'as resistance' and 'as latent knowledge' [[Four Data Discourses and Assemblage Forms A Methodological Framework|(Fussell, 2022)]] that can be instrumentalised for socio-political change. The [[experiential knowledge]] shared online (particularly by multiply marginalised people) has such resistive potential due to its "eudaimonic (i.e., emotionally poignant, existential, or vulnerable)" quality [[Journaling into the void - TikTok's eudaimonic 'web-weaving' and its digital practises|(Moger, 2024, pp. iv)]]. This can surface as shared joy and solidarity but also as 'affective dissonance' (Hemmings, 2012), where anger and grief resonates in the 'onto-epistemological gap' between embodied and prescripted lives [[library/Lubunya Assemblages - Queer Networked Resistances in Turkey|(Kilic, 2024)]]. This affect proliferated through a network directly 'spurs action' to bridge the gap (Hemmings, 2012). Kilic [[library/Lubunya Assemblages - Queer Networked Resistances in Turkey|(2024)]], in their discussion of queer [[counter-archives|counter-archival practices]] in Turkey, describes how this circulation of affect allows "an everyday or individualised action \[to] eventually become transformative,". They describe the Lubunca term "gullüm alıkmak" (or making gullüm) as 'collective act of joy or humour as resistance' that can incite restorative change in the face of this dissonance ([[library/Lubunya Assemblages - Queer Networked Resistances in Turkey|Kilic, 2024]]). 

Through my own use of internet platforms I've engaged in information practises both **as and for** self-emancipation towards collective liberation. This research explores how others do the same, from social blogging platform [[tumblr|Tumblr]] to 'digital scrapbook' [[Pinterest]] (D'Amore, 2016) and its [[works/thesis/thesis-practise#^d9889c|cooler cousin]] [[Are.na]]. Sharing affective experiential fragments is common on both [[tumblr|Tumblr]] and [[Are.na]] as they can be seen as [[Blurred Public-Private Boundaries and Ethical Practices Through a Case Study on Instagram#^452c9f|'intimate public[s]']] (Berlant, 2008, p. viii) of the personal on semi-public display. Users can assume a '[[Blurred Public-Private Boundaries and Ethical Practices Through a Case Study on Instagram#^c5d489|common feeling]]' in their '[[Blurred Public-Private Boundaries and Ethical Practices Through a Case Study on Instagram#^98f1d7|imagined audiences]]' ([[Blurred Public-Private Boundaries and Ethical Practices Through a Case Study on Instagram|Ravn, Barnwell and Neves, 2021]]) that allows their perspective to resonate with others of similar experience. Tumblr users assemble [[multi-modal]] fragments of both practical resources and experiential knowledge into singular affective experiences through 'web-weaving' (a.k.a. parallel posts or # parallels), a cross-platform practise of "[[Parallel Posts#^9666b6|transformative transtextuality]]" originated by Tumblr users ([[Parallel Posts|Rose, 2023; 2025]]; [[Journaling into the void - TikTok's eudaimonic 'web-weaving' and its digital practises#^3af4e0|Moger, 2024]]). Both a web-weaving post (see Fig. 1), a threaded chain of 'reblogs' [[tumblr (book)|(Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021)]] or a Tumblr blog can be considered a *resistive fragment assemblage* of juxtaposed elements. I'll [[thesis-practise|later discuss]] how Pinterest and Are.na also achieve this designation, to varying degrees.

## Resistive counterpublics online

Rose [[Parallel Posts#^8263e6|(2025)]] describes [[tumblr|Tumblr]] as a "broadly counterpublic gathering" that focuses on feminism, queer experience, NSFW topics, social justice and mental health [[tumblr (book)|(Tiidenberg, Henry and Abidin, 2021, pp. 9)]]. Users describe it as "communal, consciousness-raising, therapeutic and educational" [[tumblr (book)#^558c77|(Tiidenberg, Henry and Abidin, 2021, pp. 9)]]. Its "persevering influence" ([[Parallel Posts#^f5c0fe|Rose, 2025, pp.34]]) on wider cultures, as the origin of shifting discourse and widely-circulated screenshots [[Parallel Posts#^394e35|(Rose, 2025 pp.175)]], earns it the characterisation of "simultaneously countercultural, subcultural, and trendsetting" ([[Parallel Posts#^a882b5|Rose, 2025, pp.1]]). 

Whilst Rose [[Parallel Posts|(2025)]] attributes desire for [[Parallel Posts#^d56dd4|knowledge-building]] associated with fandom and "[[Parallel Posts|bookishness]]", this culture is also driven by the structurally subversive [[Parallel Posts#^f04d44|feed-first infrastructure, allowance for anonymity and disconnection from commercial income]] ([[Parallel Posts|Rose, 2023; 2025]]; [[tumblr (book)|Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021]]). This combination of structural potential and wider cultural influence situates the incubation of affective counter-publics online as liberatory practise. Rather than Tumblr, I've chosen to focus my initial enquiry on Pinterest, as it hosts similar content in its undercurrent despite being both culturally and structurally steeped in capitalist modes of production ([[library/Public Curation and Private Collection The Production of Knowledge on Pinterest.Com|Lui, 2015]]). 

Pinterest is both used instrumentally and "enables the invaluable creation of information in addressing people’s affective demands," ([[Creating by Me, and for Me Investigating the Use of Information Creation in Everyday Life|Lee, Ocepek and Makri, 2021]]). Examining Pinterest boards on counter-hegemonic topics allows us to isolate the limitations of mainstream information infrastructure and specify where multi-threaded, '[[Parallel Posts#^be56ce|multi-modal]]' and '[[Parallel Posts#^6bb938|hyperconnected]]' ([[Parallel Posts|Rose, 2025]]) or 'rhizomatic' (Tekobbe, 2013) systems would add to this combined affective and instrumental capacity.

## Curating for ourselves and others

Marketed as a site for 'inspiration' or improving 'life and work' ("About," 2013, cited in [[Public Curation and Private Collection The Production of Knowledge on Pinterest.Com|Lui, 2015, pp.129]]), Pinterest is a contested space of [[anti~consumerism|commercialisation]] caught in the neo-liberal trap of individualism. Its infrastructure encourages users to save with intent to purchase rather than share in a collective dream [[Public Curation and Private Collection The Production of Knowledge on Pinterest.Com|(Lui, 2015)]]. Despite many personal boards being [[blurred public-private boundaries online|technically public]], the mass of content affords a kind of '[[privacy in public on Pinterest|privacy in public]]'. Lui describes this [[blurred public-private boundaries online|blurring of boundaries]] as "the distinction between [[curation]] and [[collection]]" ([[library/Public Curation and Private Collection The Production of Knowledge on Pinterest.Com|ibid., pp.133]]), as 'it is understood' ([[library/Public Curation and Private Collection The Production of Knowledge on Pinterest.Com|ibid., pp.132]]), that collections are public, but I disagree; Pinterest users often don't realise or acknowledge (Zarro, Hall and Forte, 2013; Lundgren, Curcio and Schroeder, 2021) that their pins are publicly available, using boards for "private fantasies and personal dreams" (Phillips, Miller and McQuarrie, 2014). 

Collecting for ourselves and collecting for others is not always a clear intentional shift. The practise of [[commoning]] under collectivism actively [[the commons blurs the boundaries of altruistic and selfish intent|dismantles this boundary]], as whether the intent was first for yourself or first for the collective, both you and the collective will benefit. For metadata, research from [[Web 1.0]] explores tagging practises as both selfish and altruistic (Hammond et al., 2005). Tumblr's tags too are described as both personal and metacommunicative [[tumblr (book)|(Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021)]]. Ingber [[Understanding Screenshot Collection and Sharing on Messaging Platforms A Privacy Perspective|(2025)]] stresses the distinction between collection for yourself and for others in capturing screenshots of personal messages due to 'privacy turbulence', a concept elaborated by Smolicki ([[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|2017]]), whose "camera, always pointing outwards, covered other people" - as our intimate lives involve the intimate lives of others, our [[privacy is contextual|privacy]] is inherently contested space.

Instead of intended audience, I distinguish [[curation]] from collection by its [[recombination|recombinatory]] nature. In the juxtaposition of elements we're offered room to reflect and rearrange (Smolicki, 2017, [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^d45340|pp. 26]], [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^dc3c8b|pp. 60]]), and so the value of an assemblage is in unique combination of fragments in differing priorities and contexts. Even in traditional curated exhibits, "the visitor is encouraged to actively \[...] build their own connections", and "need not follow the same path as the curator, nor reach the same conclusion" [[Curation, Curation, Curation|(Wolff and Mulholland, 2013)]]. To learn from what you're consuming, there must be deliberate "interpretation and organisation" of information [[Curation, Curation, Curation|(Wolff and Mulholland, 2013)]]. Nomadic data discourse in [[Critical Data Studies|CDS]] describes how the [[recombined fragments|recombination of data fragments]] has unlimited potential for qualitative transformation, unlike statist treatments of quantitative data. Here, fragments can 'enter into new combinations without arbitrary limit or so-called “natural” or “hierarchical” uses and meanings’ (Nail, 2017: 32-33, cited in [[Four Data Discourses and Assemblage Forms A Methodological Framework|Fussell, 2022]]).

## Intersubjectivity

As individuals, our situated [[power in the single perspective|singular perspective]] is the interface to the collective. The point at which our own frameworks [[affective category theory|diverge]] from another's can then be of "powerful personal significance." [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.146)]]. Smolicki [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(2017)]] describes personal, intentional, curational practises as 'para-archival' in that they "foreground the accounts of the everyday that are formed singularly and silently from within", **parallel** rather than counter-to hegemonic strategy ([[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]], pp.137). I attend to [[para-archival practise|para-archival]] as [[slow tactics|para-tactics]]: an extension beyond the dichotomy of strategy vs tactics where "resistance seem\[s] to emerge slowly, stubbornly, and persistently, over longer periods of time" ([[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]], pp. 117, 145). 

A singular subjectivity is in many cultures the determinant of a 'self', but I prefer to define it as a "multidimensional construct containing both one's intra- and interpersonal beings" (Maurer et al., 2023). Both "personal and collective experience are intertwined" ([[library/Parallel Posts|Rose, 2025]], pp. 36; [[tumblr (book)|Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021]]) on Tumblr, and Pinterest boards are formed on personal semantics that are influenced by but distinct from other users (Tekobbe, 2013). As **affective technologies** can "combat alienation from oneself and others." [[Journaling into the void - TikTok's eudaimonic 'web-weaving' and its digital practises|(Moger, 2024)]], such platforms preclude an interdependent selfhood inherently connected to context and to other people ([[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]], pp. 219). In combining fragments for both "practical and conceptual needs" and the "transpersonal welfare of the collective" [[Creating by Me, and for Me Investigating the Use of Information Creation in Everyday Life#^f7e084|(Lee, Ocepek and Makri, 2021)]], networked assemblage constitutes [[collectivism|resistance to individualism]] and universalism.

 In combining individuals into wholes, [[from web 1.0 to web 2.0|the current era of innovation period]] largely focuses on the aggregate, increasingly in the form of large language models (LLMs). I'd argue that the only ethical form of "linguistically generated intersubjectivity" (Habermas, cited by [[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation|Rettburg, 2005]]), combines individuals through active consent, direct participation and minimal [[remediation]], in order to represent "alternative, non-centric conceptual zones, fluid individual practices and imaginations" without subsuming these peripheries into a new centre ([[Four Data Discourses and Assemblage Forms A Methodological Framework|Fussell, 2022]], pp.15; [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]], pp. 47). This would constitute Smolicki's 'responsible construction of subjecthood'  ([[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|2017]], pp. 74), through 'folding' or 'internalizing' of outside forces (Deleuze, 1991).

External mnemonic traces, particularly by marginalised people, can construct [[counter-publics]] as resistive communities form through [[trans-individuation]] (or, shared meanings) [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.54)]]. Both Moger [[Journaling into the void - TikTok's eudaimonic 'web-weaving' and its digital practises|(2024)]] and Smolicki [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^114f92|(2017)]] discuss external archives in terms of [[self-transcendence]], at the (later added) peak of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Whilst Maslow's concepts are useful in categorising practical and relational needs, representing individualised needs in a hierarchical relationship with the collective is an inherently Eurocentric paradigm, misrepresenting the worldview of the Blackfoot nation that inspired it (Kapisi, Choate and Lindstrom, 2022). 

I'll instead frame general purpose assemblages (of inherent non-linearity) as meeting each need in parallel. [[para-archival practise|Para-archival practise]] conducted in networked space acknowledges 'the heterogeneity and plurality of micro-perspectives" [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.137)]], in appeal to  [[pluriversality]] through "subjectivity shared with others" [[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation#^fbf6b4|(Rettburg, 2005)]]. In my own experience I relate this concept to [[holotropism]]: articulated by Mirra [[Holotropism A Multi-Dimensional, Spacious, Edgeless Terrain|(2023)]] as a combination of [[monotropism|monotropic theory]] and [[deep ecology]] through the lived experience of specifically autistic 'coherence', 'wholeness' and 'effortless integration' with all interconnected things ([[Holotropism A Multi-Dimensional, Spacious, Edgeless Terrain|Mirra, 2023]]; [[Demystifying the ‘Pluriverse’ as the Hegemony Unravels|(Chattopadhyay, 2024]]). 

## Decentralisation and Data Ownership as Resistance 

If material [[mnemonic traces]] can constitute the self [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp. 219)]], ownership and privacy of this self is important. Through the [[forced techno-progressivism|forced technological progressivism]] of [[Web 2.0]], individual archival practises have been [[from mnemotechnique to mnemotechnology|transformed]], 'contaminated and instrumentalized by economic, commercial, and political agendas ([[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^f99ee5|Smolicki, 2017]], pp. 111) in an era of widespread [[platformisation]] under [[cognitive capitalism|capitalist realism]] (Fisher, 2009). These 'easily monitorable [[mnemotechniques and mnemotechnologies|mnemotechnological]] enclosures' ([[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^f99ee5|Smolicki, 2017]], pp. 62) are able to dominate attention, meaning-making and privacy as they "make people adapt, somewhat passively, to their internal rules" ([[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]], pp. 56-57).

The primary *structural* features of a more equitable internet are [[decentralisation]] and data ownership.  We can strengthen networked technologies of the self [[Parallel Posts#^eb4287|(Rose, 2023; 2025)]] through the 'ideological infrastructure' [[The Xenofeminist Manifesto|(Cuboniks, 2019)]] of data sovereignty, or, the rights of users to their own externalisations. If we choose to engage with [[mnemotechniques and mnemotechnologies|mnemotechniques]] as "**intentional** practices of externalizing memory and knowledge" ([[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]], emphasis added) we can [[active decision-making for regaining agency under controlling structures|regain or retain agency]] within cultures of automated data capture. Smolicki [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^1ce7f6|(2017)]] describes this as a shift from passive to active forms of remembering, or from '[[capture|capturing]]' to '[[recording]]'. Citing Steigler's 'originary prostheticity' (1998, p.153), Smolicki also claims that [[internal and external memory|external memory cues]] or [[mnemonic traces]] are 'inseparable' from internal structures [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^feaa4c|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.53-54)]], justifying the use of mnemotechnologies that better enable mnemotechnical practise. If we reject the notion of the 'natural' as the [[The Xenofeminist Manifesto#^c0acc9|sacred]] ([[The Xenofeminist Manifesto|Cuboniks, 2019]]), there is [[cyborgs|no consistently meaningful boundary between body and tool]]. As a disabled and neurodivergent scholar in particular, I demand higher standards of autonomy over data mind-bodies. 

Another motivating goal that is "both utopian and practical" is that of [[permacomputing]] - to maintain robust, future-proof technological systems with reduced environmental impact. Decentralised systems for data storage and backup are more robust against technical faults ([[Where Wizards Stay Up Late|Hafner and Lyon, 1998]], p.27), natural or political crises (Abbate, 2000) and isolated impacts on a singular company's servers. Even in accessing Are.na during research I was afforded an ironically fortuitous example of single-point failure when a [Cloudflare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare) fault took out Are.na along with much larger sites ([McMahon, 2025](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c629pny4gl7o)). 

Data ownership is a more widely contested issue, with companies claiming rights over data for which they're ineligible, in order to profit from its exploitation (Versaci, 2018). [[Critical Data Studies]] emphasises the [[harm reduction|reduction of harm]] to marginalised groups in use of their data, calling for more control over when we are required or coerced into giving certain data and more robust consent mechanisms. Self-storage (or at least a diverse range of storage providers) for personal data with fine-grained access control (Sambra _et al._, 2016), as well as compliance from end applications, is necessary to prevent unwanted harvesting or leakage of personal information. More assurance of privacy and the scope of audience for individual fragments can enable the prior discussed intimate counter-publics, incubating resistance and wider systemic change.
