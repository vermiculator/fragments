## data collection
### Are.na
- individual blocks on Are.na usage were collected on an account specifically for this purpose and downloaded through the 'Are.na manager' Obsidian plugin by Javier Arce
- I listed these blocks with the [Dataview plugin for Obsidian](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and copied it to markdown
- entire channels were collected by generating a document with print.are.na.book and copying the whole contents into markdown - the easiest method of pulling all posts, titles, descriptions and users who added to the channel

### Pinterest
- pins for each board were downloaded as imgs and json data with WfDownloader
- I summarised each pin's format and main features and selected those that were of particular relevance, interest and pertinence to fully transcribe
- accompanying metadata was extracted from the json files with Visual Studio Code plugins:
	- JSONPath Extraction (using [[minor process details|these queries]])
	- [Command on All Files](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rioj7.commandOnAllFiles)
	- [multi-command](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryuta46.multi-command)
	- [Bracketeer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pustelto.bracketeer)
- 

## both
- Any text from images was transcribed by the [Text Extractor plugin for Obsidian ](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-text-extractor) and manually checked/corrected.
