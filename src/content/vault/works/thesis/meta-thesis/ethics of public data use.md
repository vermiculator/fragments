"**Many people think that anonymizing social media posts is a good citation strategy that protects users’ privacy. But it’s not.**“Even when anonymized by not including usernames, content from social media collected and shared in research articles can be easily traced back to its creator,” as Dym and Fiesler assert, drawing on a [study by John W. Ayers and colleagues](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-018-0036-2). Basically, you can google the text of a social media post and find the original post, context, and its author extremely easily."  - from [Melanie Walsh on Medium](https://melanie-walsh07.medium.com/recommendations-and-updates-for-using-social-media-data-in-research-whether-youre-in-english-1a13c3e85e5d)

"The other big problem with anonymization is that it robs users of authorship. **Creators deserve intellectual credit** **for what they create and publish**, as [Amy Bruckman and others have maintained](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021316409277)." - from [Melanie Walsh on Medium](https://melanie-walsh07.medium.com/recommendations-and-updates-for-using-social-media-data-in-research-whether-youre-in-english-1a13c3e85e5d)

"Additionally, they did not include the actual text of tweets in their report and **only included links to the tweets**, essentially enabling users to delete their tweets and remove themselves from the study." - from [Melanie Walsh on Medium](https://melanie-walsh07.medium.com/recommendations-and-updates-for-using-social-media-data-in-research-whether-youre-in-english-1a13c3e85e5d)

"Dym and Fiesler recommend **paraphrasing posts** in such a way that they are not traceable back to the original post" - from [Melanie Walsh on Medium](https://melanie-walsh07.medium.com/recommendations-and-updates-for-using-social-media-data-in-research-whether-youre-in-english-1a13c3e85e5d)
