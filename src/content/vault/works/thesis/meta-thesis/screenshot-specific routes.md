title: 'screenshot-specific routes'
---

A theme in capture-curation that I've not had the space yet to develop and explore, but is of great potential, and I've collected various thoughts/theories/insights on.

## from [[works/thesis/meta-thesis/Are.na analysis]]
- cruft - auto-capture - cookie banners, ads, social buttons, large menus, donation banners etc take up the auto-screenshot space. these screenshots rarely useful, maybe to archival but not curation. - peripheral articles in screenshots maybe useful...

## principles - features
