See the [[works/thesis/thesis-practise|main body of my thesis]] for context and discussion of the most relevant themes, see below for the details of my analysis, or see '[[works/thesis/meta-thesis/more meta-blocks|more meta blocks]]' for individual blocks. The full list of codes is [[works/thesis/meta-thesis/meta-block codes|here ->]]

sub-question: 
	- how do Are.na users conceptualise a) the platform, b) its users, c) the content, d) its features and functions and e) the experience of using it? 

possible additional questions: 
	- what are their self-confessed a) likes b) dislikes c) habits? 
	- what common methods do they use to workaround/adapt/adjust the platforms to their needs?

## Some Discussion

Text blocks precipitate additional patterns of use to Pinterest's, such as [[excerpting]] and journaling. Saving PDFs is of huge microcultural and infrastructural significance as Are.na also now functions as a searchable textual archive. Allowing capture of a raw url is another benefit of this [[multi-modal|multi-modality]]. Both Are.na and Pinterest's bookmarks insist on an image cover, an uncommon pattern in bookmarking which [[refinding is quicker from images than text|can be useful for refinding]] [[Screenshot Situations|(Tyżlik-Carver, 2022)]], but in aggregate produces redundant visual clutter of auto-screenshots. I determined that Are.na's bookmarks covered common categories: organisations, articles, resources and temporal bookmarks. Resource bookmarks would've often been more useful as embedded lists of links but sometimes included web tools or unusual formats. Temporal bookmarks were those with associated dates and deadlines: bookmarks never intended to persist.

Are.na appears to be most commonly used in extra-institutional and creative research. Cobb (2010) describes learning as "becoming a curator for that area"; "In a sense, this is what academics have always done." (Cobb, 2010, no pagination). Are.na emerges as **alt-academia** for those with interests too specific, creative or transdisciplinary to be encapsulated by traditional media and methods.
## Some Meta

### Consent
- Whilst I only dealt with public data, I asked for consent to include blocks as quotes or embedded in the text/site. 
- I determined the culture of Are.na over Pinterest to be more willing to engage with my research and also to be directly connected due to the platform's structure and ethos.
- As Are.na includes authored text blocks I judged it fairer to allow intellectual credit to users [(Walsh, 2023)](https://melanie-walsh07.medium.com/recommendations-and-updates-for-using-social-media-data-in-research-whether-youre-in-english-1a13c3e85e5d)

### Notes
- this analysis is to understand the sort of metaphors that are being used by Are.na users to describe Are.na, as I (and presumably the are.na team who posted this and users who contributed) believe metaphors are important in design - ensuring mental models of the infrastructure builders match the mental models of the users. Here I find what motivates the use of this platform, what sort of comparisons are made and how the users most concisely conceptualise their process, the platform, its users and its media content.
- comments are a thing on are.na
	- I've chosen not to include them as they're deprioritised in the interface and not widely used
	- The majority of these blocks do not have comments
- descriptions and titles of blocks are also not used consistently or widely so I included them in the content for analysis
	- I don't believe them to be individually significant in this channel
	- The majority of these blocks do not have titles or descriptions
- images that consist only of text are transcribed directly here
- a few image/link blocks with limited text were excluded
	- there weren't many and they were mostly references to other media
	- I didn't have the resources to assess the meaning/pertinence of these blocks
	- meme and media analysis is beyond the scope of this work
- I haven't included timestamps, and some of these descriptions may be more or less accurate to particular platform changes according to their dates.
- users adding blocks to the channel later had access to view previous blocks, which accounts for some similarity in format of answer, but may also have produced more unique answers for a time, and it is unlikely that users read the full channel prior to adding as it it got lengthier
