### meta-methods:
some really useful ways to work out my thoughts along the way have been:
- mindmapping the links between concepts I wanted to cover
- rejecting (for now at least) parts of the map more loosely connected and not necessary to the cohesive whole
- wrote an overview of the initial motivations in a connected story a -> b -> c
- started bullet pointing things to make sure I write about - largely my justifications for why I've selected particular methods or platforms and why certain focuses are important (to me and in general)
- listing what it actually is I'm wanting to capture on the day to day - bringing it right back to the simple personal everyday
- creating this index for various areas I split off, to encourage my continued reflections in each
- 'insights from' platforms, literature, own experience - then collating the common themes and splitting them off into their own pages

## research ethics
-  [[ethics of public data use]] 
- another really important moment for me:
	- I was aware some of the topics of 'resistance' might get dicey with regards to legality, violence and conflict but I'd figured this would be managed through any individual discussion with individual people and examples chosen
	- But I was beginning to find that in aggregate that patterns of specific imagery and wording associated with particular resistive groups could be equally used to profile individuals. In this kind of online spaces there are long-lasting symbols of particular movements mixed in with newer, subtler or nicher forms of affiliation to various causes.
	- On beginning to code the presence of these indicators/language/symbols associated with radical left wing groups I felt a kind of shadow of the lists the UK government keeps on suspected terrorist groups. Given the tendency for any movement resisting oppressive regimes to be marked with the same brush of 'radical' and 'violent', I felt that compiling any list of subtler indicators of collectivist ideals gained from my own experience amongst this kind of online content would be a tool I would rather not hand to would-be, could-be or already-are oppressors.
	- I decided that the ethical decision would be to 
		- not code content themes of Pinterest images
		- focus on pins encouraging specific acts of future-building
		- limit descriptive coding to format and source
		- not transcribe many directly
	- and as this also cut down the workload, it seems to make sense
