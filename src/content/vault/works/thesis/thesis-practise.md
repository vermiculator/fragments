## Forms of Resistance

Much of the resistive content of [[Pinterest analysis details|assemblages on Pinterest]] was in **actionable utopias** (creation, development, building, doing) and **actionable dystopias** (destruction, dismantling, abolition, undoing). In **connecting past, present and future** users were able to articulate visions of [[collective future-building|collective futures]], often by **making sense/nonsense** (denaturalisation, catharsis, confusions, absurdism and existentialism), bringing attention to complexities of socio-economic-political climates. I interpreted content variously as **counter-strategy**, **counter-tactics** or a [[tactics vs strategy|blurring of the two]], as discussed in depth by Smolicki [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(2017)]] in the articulation of [[para-archival practise|para-archival]] [[slow tactics|tactics]]. Much of this could also be interpreted as **self actualisation** and **self-transcendence** as messaging focused on the [[long-term capacity-building]] of individuals, groups and communities.

 [[works/thesis/meta-thesis/Are.na analysis|On Are.na]], content was more likely to indicate **earnest exploration** of a topic in depth, with less couched signals. Reference to [[collective responsibility]] was more explicit, in line with the platform's ethos (['About'](https://www.are.na/about), 2025). Fragments [[works/thesis/meta-thesis/Are.na analysis|on Are.na]] were altogether more hopeful and action-focused than [[Pinterest analysis details|on Pinterest]]. The tone is often '[communal, conceptual, and even vulnerable](https://www.are.na/block/38842878/)'. As reflected in the [[Are.na meta-analysis|meta-analysis]], this tendency can largely be attributed to the affordances of **multi-modality** which was explicitly valued by users. The combination of **instrumental** and **affective** fragments is more potent than on Pinterest as fragments can also be links, PDFs and embeds (for practical resources) and free-text (for affective commentary or expressing [[experiential knowledge]]). Are.na users evidenced an "embed\[ded] awareness of and preparation for the future" in their curated assemblages, described by Smolicki [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(2017)]] as characteristic of [[para-archival practise]].

## Resistive Cultures

Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin [[tumblr (book)|(2021)]] discuss the implications of **multi-modality** on [[tumblr|Tumblr]] usage. In interviews exploring later changes to the platform, a Tumblr user shared: "I miss a space where I could explore and construct a juxtapositional, incoherent, multifaceted version of myself...a particular engaged, kind audience...a space where I contained multitudes" [[tumblr (book)|(Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021)]]. Are.na appears to be one such space. I found my impressions from the [[works/thesis/meta-thesis/Are.na analysis|initial analysis]] echoed in the [[Are.na meta-analysis|meta-analysis]] by users who viewed their Are.na usage as a maturation of their time on Tumblr (["post-Tumblr"](https://www.are.na/block/17029606), ["tumblr graduation"](https://www.are.na/block/13297652/)). A sense of "[digital intimacy](https://www.are.na/block/8028046)" alongside a "pedagogy for social change" [[tumblr (book)|(Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021, pp.135)]] is evident on both Tumblr and Are.na. Are.na was repeatedly deemed as '[like pinterest but good](https://www.are.na/block/21152054)', or as a Pinterest/Tumblr structural/cultural mix. 

<ArenaGrid><ArenaEmbed id="27662770"></ArenaEmbed>
<ArenaEmbed id="17029606"></ArenaEmbed></ArenaGrid>

As an **incubator** of experimental and subversive digital practise, Are.na users commonly [[working in public|work in public]] and value this **open sourcing of process**. This is echoed in turn by the company publishing transparent roadmaps, remaining committed to community feedback and providing open channels of discussion (['About'](https://www.are.na/about), 2025). Are.na is seen by users as a **new underground** - a diverse, engaged community, or **esoteric** [[counter-publics|counter-public]]. Where Pinterest has been described as a 'community of people who don’t know each other' (Zarro, Hall and Forte, 2013), Are.na users feel closer, regarding each other as **friendly strangers**. Are.na constituted for them a, or *the*, "[Good Internet](https://www.are.na/block/6628392/)". Unlike most [[mnemotechniques and mnemotechnologies|mnemotechnologies]], it encourages the development of **practises and rituals** that extend beyond the platform as [[mnemotechniques and mnemotechnologies|mnemotechniques]], allowing users to 'renegotiate' their 'agential dependencies' [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]]. Many employ personal indexes with codes, icons and keywords imposing personal structure over the default **flat ontology** in practises I'd characterise as "tactical appropriation" employed "to serve a specific, individuated purpose" [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp. 144)]]. [[para-archival practise|Para-archival practises]] on Are.na are persistent, bottom-up, [[slow tactics]] that resist today's dominant mnemotechnological [[platforms and silos|silos]]. ^d9889c

## (Hyper)active Exploratory Agency
<ArenaGrid><ArenaEmbed id="769369"></ArenaEmbed></ArenaGrid>

How users conceptualise their freedoms, [[works/thesis/thesis-practise#cognitive capitalism Capitalist Realism|however accurate]], is of great interest here. I found that **flexibility** alone is a surprisingly common draw to Are.na, perhaps as 'channels' are so personal, reflecting a non-persistent selfhood "exposed in media, \[forming] realities or identities that can be accessed, shaped, and continuously re-edited" [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.63)]].  Overwhelmingly, Are.na users extol the **[[active decision-making for regaining agency under controlling structures|active agency]]** in **curation** and show a strong preference for **[[slow labour]]**, as the literature suggested. Users explicitly express that they are **anti-AI**, **anti-algorithm** and **anti-ad**, or more widely that they feel **in control** on this platform. 

<ArenaGrid><ArenaEmbed id="31955258"></ArenaEmbed>
</ArenaGrid>

The primary facilitator of more active exploration on Are.na as compared to Pinterest is its **multi-directional connectivity**. Threading through others' **trails** of thought encourages **rabbitholes** of information-seeking, or ["hunting for truffles in a forest"](https://www.are.na/block/17029606). Are.na users tend to self-identify as researchers, artists, **nerds and techies** with niche interests. I termed this **(hyper)active** exploration as a nod to neurodivergent 'special interests' or hyperfixations that deeply explore niche topics from diverse angles. I found largely consistent demand for "selectivity as opposed to totality" [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.102)]], with care given to what is collected and (de-/)organised. This may ironically be enhanced by the 'free tier' block limit as users reflect on which resources are worth quantifiable space on servers. (Perhaps I wouldn't feel galled by this limit if it was tangibly felt to be for local resource limits rather than an ephemeral boundary surmountable through capital, once again. I hold off on harsh judgement as the company is considering a co-operative model (‘About’, 2025)).

## Reflexive Curation

 Juxtaposing [[embodied knowledge|embodied]], [[experiential knowledge|experiential]] knowledges with traditional sources provide reflexive space in its reconfiguration [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]]. Whilst some **[hoarding](https://www.are.na/block/28922405)** behaviour on both Pinterest and Are.na resembles "nothing more than collection" (Wolff and Mulholland, 2013, no pagination), Are.na users more often [[works/thesis/meta-thesis/Are.na analysis|depict]] or [[Are.na meta-analysis|explicitly strive for]] **curation** as defined prior by **deliberate organisation** or collection along specific themes. 
 
The design implication of diverse **practises**, reflexive **curation** and demand for **agency** is to provide extensibility and not enforce one singular method of interaction. Crucially, this excludes from consideration more automated forms of curation such as those employed lately by Pinterest ([Pinterest Newsroom, 2025](https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en-gb/news/introducing-auto-collages-shopping-and-trend-forecasting-cannes-2025/)). As discussed [[works/thesis/thesis-context#^f3c77f|prior]], it is in the active decisions over including, excluding, labelling and recombining fragments that their human impact is felt. 

## Everything Everywhere All At Once

Are.na is commonly described as a 'second brain', an *extension* or *replacement* of the first. I want to highlight the difference between these metaphors to align with Smolicki's [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(2017)]] call for 'synergy versus substitution' with mnemotechnologies. [[Second brains are just as faulty as first brains (just differently so)]]. Many Are.na users referred to it more as an **extended memory** or **brain interface** than party to cognition itself, which aligns with the [[works/thesis/thesis-context#^fdd06b|prior discussion]] of [[externalised memory]]. Metaphors tended more towards **brain prosthesis** or **tunnels** between brains than to computerised intelligence.

<ArenaEmbed id="1140902"></ArenaEmbed>
</ArenaGrid>

The **immediacy** and **transparency** of the platform felt to some like [[ambient intelligence]]. There was mixed sentiment on the **infinite** nature of this **void**-like space, with some **information overload** and mentions of **addiction** or **artificial highs** as well as frequent praise that there was **no noise** to distract users from their individual goals. I believe it is mostly the ethos rather than the structure of the platform that limits feature creep and attention-grabbing behaviours. Interestingly, co-founder [Damon Zucconi]( https://www.are.na/damon-zucconi/blocks) described the experience as '[productive coveillance](https://www.are.na/block/1258645)', a not uncommon pattern of usage that nevertheless neglects the ultra-personal. Affective fragments are often intended for specific audiences and require more concern for privacy. The post-Tumblr audience values the 'protective opacity' of anonymity (McCracken, 2020), suggesting that surveillance metaphors are misplaced.

## Porta(b)l(e) Memory


<ArenaGrid>
<ArenaEmbed id="16407275"></ArenaEmbed>
</ArenaGrid>

This highly prevalent theme in my [[Are.na meta-analysis]] spoke directly to the infrastructure.  Many users saw Are.na as a **transparent portal** to '[connect us into different people’s minds](https://www.are.na/block/38842878)' or to their own **externalised self**. This title also speaks to **portability**. Are.na is very effective as a **portal** to information, due to its **flat ontology** and directly embedded data. For it to feel **portable** however it needs to be retrievable on the widest possible range of devices, in as many formats as possible and be easily ported in or out of the system at will. This requirement is where data format decisions become important and where I believe Are.na lets itself down.

The major structural limitations of Are.na are its *centralised data store and *non-standard data format*. I'd argue that Are.na users overestimate how reconfigurable their content is on this platform and Are.na benefits greatly from comparison to more prohibitive tools. All user data is stored centrally without options for migration (and with limited export options). The 'Are.na commons' is not a true [[digital commons]] as it is centrally managed and approved ([Are.na Commons](https://www.are.na/are-na-commons/channels), 2025). Designating this space as **the commons** de-emphasises open channels originated by other accounts and 'orphans' those transferred, but does offer the benefit of [[#contextualisation/decontextualisation and sharing annotations|disassociating from]] your 'silly little ideas'. (Ironically, the author of the block I'm quoting here wished to remain anonymous.)

Whilst Are.na's data is available via API and committed community members are extending its capacity, it would ideally be directly available in standard file formats such as markdown, HTML, JSON or XML. The fault-tolerant, resilient mnemotechnologies designed under xenofeminism and permacomputing should 'coexist simultaneously with extant systems," ([[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation|Rettburg, 2005, pp. 2]]; [[Understanding Screenshot Collection and Sharing on Messaging Platforms A Privacy Perspective|Ingber, 2025]]), a priority I found lacking in both Pinterest and Are.na.

## Beyond [[cognitive capitalism|Capitalist Realism]]

The primary limitation of Are.na is that it functions as a company first. Despite the innovative imaginings, community-centred feature development, open-sourcing of code and commitment to ethical principles, Are.na is still fundamentally business-minded, locking features behind paywalls and running as a singular closed dev team. It's not in my interest nor skillset to conduct a full investigation of Are.na's business practises. With wide community involvement by founders and stated plans to consider a co-operative structure in time (“About”, 2025), their commitment to their userbase is stronger than most. I consider my role here to be to explore the possibilities of tools not unlike Are.na without the constraints of capital - to remove the assumption of effective tools being measured by number of users and/or opportunities for revenue. Working from the basis of decentralised storage (in at-home, in-community or distributed servers) already goes some way to reduce costs of running central content provision. 

## Connectivity and Control through Solid

A mnemotechnique that allows **reconfigurability** must allow fragments to be modular, arbitrarily arrangeable and have robust fine-grained privacy so data can be (primarily) stored [[all in one place]] for an individual. Data pertaining to a collective can be stored by collectives in a model of networked stores. A network of local commons respects the situatedness of data storage in [[the internet as physical infrastructure|physical servers]] whilst prioritising [[accessibility]] and [[connectivity]], in line with collectivist and xenofeminist desires [[The Xenofeminist Manifesto|(Cuboniks, 2019)]]. 

Whilst numerous [[Web 1.0]] standards persist on today's web, the Semantic Web holds weight in its focus on both human- and machine- readable data that is highly contextual, reconfigurable and structured according to self-definable schemas. In situating a solution to the task of *connectivity* with *fine-grained privacy* in the [[semantic web]] I was reminded of Berners-Lee's [Solid project](https://solidproject.org/about) (Sambra et al., 2016) and the Fediverse's ActivityPub protocol. Momentum behind both projects seems consistent, and both retain alignment with ethical foundations. [ActivityPods](https://activitypods.org) combines the two for decentralised communication between distributed data stores, and embedded read-write system *[doekieli](https://dokie.li/)* can handle basic markdown file editing within the Solid context.

This thesis is not intended to fully articulate a fragment-based mnemotechnology using Solid, but more to call for its creation. As a [[provotypical tools for thought|'provotypical' tool for thought]] "provoking reflection on alternate modes of personal archives and post-digital memory practices," [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]], [this site](/) is the ground from which I'm experimenting with the potential of Solid for [[works/thesis/thesis-context#Instrumental fragments|resistive fragment assemblages]], but it does not alone meet the demands of my findings. 

## [[semantic links|Semantic Links]] 

Beyond [[decentralisation]], the benefit of using Solid is in the [[hyperconnectivity]] it affords through [[semantic links|semantic linking]]. Both the [[#^73d764|Pinterest analysis]], [[#^c78069|Are.na analysis]] and Are.na meta-analysis highlighted the need for *meaningful associations* between fragments and other web content. For both Pinterest pins and Are.na blocks the connectivity and therefore usefulness was limited by a single option for source link (see Fig. 3). Are.na users valued the **multi-directionality** of connections between content on the platform and its **graph-like traversal** but made diverse use of the 'connection' feature. Whilst this arbitrary connection fits fleeting expression or 'generally to-do with' relations, many connections would've benefitted from structured data associated with the link. To prioritise human readability whilst making these connections useable for structured traversal, semantic statements (e.g. 'fragment1 is-a documentType1' or 'fragment2 is-sequel-to fragment1') are the preferable format. Some blocks in my Are.na analysis showed the potential of associative linking, connecting to the equivalent entries in Wikipedia, WorldCat (library search) or Google Search results. 

![[combined.png]]
Figure 3: mockups of Pinterest pins to discuss source link semantics. Pinterest's 'source' link as [[provenance]] is necessary to determine [[trust]] with historical reference such as protest images shared amongst mis/disinformation and AI-generated images. Other media such as comics and screencaps would benefit from, but do not rely on, connection to an arbitrary number of sources. Reposted or 'syndicated' content with a source link may be facsimile of a [[knowledge lineage]] but in practise it obscures original sources. To contrast, Tumblr's interface separates straightforward 'reblogs' from those that add additional content and warrant designation in the 'source' link chain.

Whilst Are.na stores only a single source link as Pinterest does, its culture encourages added provenance in the text body, title, descriptions or comments, to a greater degree than Pinterest. In text blocks, users often quote or take excerpts from longer articles, which act as **general inspiration** on Pinterest but contain more **reflexive commentary** on Are.na. Many channels are designed explicitly around a titular questions, as study guides or with **embedded navigational instructions**. Are.na's culture of connectivity and methods of capture encourage [[citational justice]].

## Interfacing the [[public, private and personal]]

<ArenaGrid>
<ArenaEmbed id="36774818"></ArenaEmbed>
</ArenaGrid>

For a truly [[pluriversality|pluriversal]] ontology, we must assume **multiple views** of the same data with no 'single source of truth'. This accounts for content 'syndicated' on multiple platforms, for contested authorship, for untraceability of digital images and versioning. Screenshots of the same site page may be 'collapsed' into a singular, multiplicitous entity, an assemblage across time and space and audience. 

Image recognition and machine learning methods are used variously to uncover new connections and match similar content. I'd argue a more ethical approach would be to adopt fine-grained privacy and consensual matches with omni-directional unique labelling. My findings in the **demand for agency** and the [[inherent multiplicity of digital content]] calls for collective assemblage that requires consent from an individual to subsume their viewpoint. This agency can be forefronted with interfaces powered by metadata properties of qualitative semantic approximation (Bergman, 2010). Insights on combining metadata comes from [[Web 1.0]] work on forming [[evolving taxonomies|'folksonomies' from 'personomies']] [[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation|(Rettburg, 2005)]]. [[Critical Data Studies|CDS]]' frameworks of [[situated knowledge|situated knowledges]] support manual, self-directed translation between personal semantics and community frameworks. The crucial difference here from AI-generated categorisation is in the individual as the arbiter of 'collapse' or 'equivalence' of their terms and someone else's. [[what is this|Here]] I've been using 'alias' and 'peer' properties to indicate arguably identical or notably dissimilar entities with particular nuance, akin to Wikipedia's 'disambiguation'. As also suggested by Ostendorff (2020) for library documents, these connections could retain the contextual meaning behind their alignment by employing [[semantic links|semantic triples]].

Fragments and their metadata can be "at the same time personal and public" [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]] and so require this consensual, self-initiated association to prevent [[false equivalence]] of terms used concurrently that shouldn't co-mingle (Dame, 2016). The **co-presence** of others, with **control** over boundaries is a common draw to Are.na, whose interface indicates the [[blurred public-private boundaries online|private / public / open / closed]] distinction prominently. As [[works/thesis/thesis-context#External Memory|previously discussed]], these boundaries allow 'lines of flight' to personal knowledge. Solid's fine-grained privacy features are a strong fit for this use case. Simultaneous presence of our intra- and inter-personal notes facilitate the shift from self-actualisation to self-transcendence discussed [[works/thesis/thesis-context#^3efdf7|prior]].  Directly overlaying comparative views or annotations could allow for [[situated logics]] of individual meaning, negotiating interpretations "either set against the hegemonic forces or compliant with them" [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]]. Crucially, the **boundaries** of included views must be self-determined and not algorithmically (read: opaquely / monetarily) influenced.

### Design for Assertion (min-maxxing metadata)

This multi-root/multi-view paradigm must extend fully to metadata. Tags are seen variously as content and metadata (Berendt and Hanser, 2007; [[Parallel Posts|Rose, 2025;]] [[tumblr (book)|Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021, pp.27]]),  and labelling under a personal semantic framework is essential for agential curation, as shown by work on [[evolving taxonomies|folksonomies]] that found individual's tags 'not settling on common decentralized meanings' (Berendt and Hanser, 2007) and that people primarily tag for themselves first ([[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation|Rettburg, 2005]]; [[Parallel Posts|Rose, 2025]]).  

Basic metadata is often contestable in itself, such as the title of a place as understood by indigenous groups or international agreement. As all statements are inherently authored and need arises to refer to others without self-asserting them, both the fragment itself and its upload/modification/inclusion must retain provenance. In weighing up semantic data formats this has major impact. Either **named graphs** or semantic **quads** replace the standard semantic triple and attach **context** to each statement. *Resistive fragment assemblages* may best apply comparisons by Massari et al. (2025), as historical provenance is the most *extreme* or *formal* extrapolation of source linking.


<ArenaGrid>
<ArenaEmbed id="11716211"></ArenaEmbed>
</ArenaGrid>


For **usability** and **multi-purpose** usage patterns, both minimal and maximal metadata must be acceptable. In my analyses, residue of information clung to screenshots from prior collection and reposting. There are [[contextualised over decontextualised fragments|cases for]] this data being retained for [[putting content in context|context]], [[provenance]] or [[knowledge lineage]] but also [[decontextualised over contextualised fragments|for extracting content]] for [[readability]], [[accessibility]] or [[privacy, security and surveillance|privacy]] (see Fig. 4). As [[contextualised and decontextualised fragments are both useful]] a tool's feature set should consider both views, such as by toggling between plaintext and [[thick screenshots]].
