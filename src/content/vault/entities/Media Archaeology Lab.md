"Founded in 2009 by Dr. Lori Emerson, the Media Archaeology Lab is a place for cross-disciplinary, experimental research, teaching, and creative practice using one of the largest collections in the world of still-functioning obsolete media. Researchers, students, teachers, artists and members of the public are encouraged to turn on, open up, play and create with items from the collection"
