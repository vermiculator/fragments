- "Our development philosophy comes down to a strong belief that solving problems is more efficient than looking for solutions. I say this to mean that, based on personal experiences, searching for a password is more expensive and less fulfilling than cracking the safe itself. It does mean reinventing the wheel many times over, but the process has led us to many unforeseen places, often in areas we had previously taken for granted, or considered solved." - [interview on esoteric.codes](https://esoteric.codes/blog/100-rabbits)
