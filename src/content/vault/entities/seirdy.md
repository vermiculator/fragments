## Extracts
- "I don’t share the same perspective as most “[[tech bros|fossbros]]” and organizations like the FSF. Software freedom is important because it gives people agency instead of delegating control to an authority; it’s not valuable in and of itself, and promoting a “[[fosssh]]” alternative that has vulnerabilities and [[a11y|accessibility]] issues is sometimes counterproductive." ^bb76a0
- "I think that simply meeting GNU’s definition of free software isn’t enough: it’s one of multiple requirements for software to avoid the possibility of [[user domestication]]."
