"You don't have to simulate a virtual world when the real world simulates itself."

---
I first found this in like 2018(?)
They've done so much more since ?!

Works with all of my ethos for [[tangible interfaces]], [[collaborative knowledge]], [[collective future-building]], open access, simple tools, [[permacomputing]], [[low-power tech]], [[low tech]], [[analogue computing]], [[visible mechanisms]], [[recombination]]

- completely [[fosssh|self-hosted]] and they work on it from within it
- [[self-exemplifying media]]

- looking to do a full deep-dive now my focus is so strongly back in this area
