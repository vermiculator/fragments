- why we can do better than Tumblr/Pinterest/Are.na
    - future works not necessarily aligned with social goals

    - paid, proprietary or commercial
    - not self-hostable or not interoperable 
    - combine their good affordances
    - is Pinterest letting its images train AI?? consent!?
- why we can do better than notetaking/tools for thought 
    - [[why multi-modal information space matters]]
    - [[why multi-purpose information space matters]]
    - free text, markdown, data portability 
    - plugin bloat
    - object-oriented option AnyType still has non-standard datatype and no export

beyond Are.na - seeing where it does and doesn't meet its promises, where other platforms do and don't meet collectivist goals, how are.na is close and far to working well for neuroqueer practises ive seen on other platforms and why those platforms are used instead, what could better suit my bodily experience of a thinking process.


through fundamental disconnect from surrounding works/reliance on Pinterest-like model/use by designers/lack of ambition in technical infrastructure/still being ultimately capitalist, but how its usage/features/structure are both a massive improvement on Pinterest and how the way the users conceptualise it tell us a lot about the aspirations of this kind of tool.
