the [[mesopolitics|mesopolitical]] and meso-organisational? shared/individual? superusers?
- 'corporate systems are too heavyweight or hierarchical for such communities because their information needs sit between individual and organizational solutions. Within informal collaborative settings, access is often quite informal, with a small group of active curators and larger groups of largely passive users' - from 'The future of PIM: pragmatics and potential' 
- wherever it said a few 'superusers' - this is what are.na is like too as shown in my work here


- with how i and many others painstakingly avoid unwilling tracking etc we "stubbornly evade capture by discipline and tenaciously hold on to aspects of life that are in many ways residual" [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]], such as manually engaging with individual data sources
	
- "Thus, the deceleration, partial de-automatization of the process of personal capture and archiving, breaking it into diversified phases, sites and rhythms, might allow for a more conscious and considerate way of negotiating the web of relations between its constituent nodes."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6avk757j69m6y1fbnc6gxh9)
- - "deceleration through re-manualization of memory practices seem to enable conditions for a more direct and careful configuration of the web of relations, or differently put, a constitution of web of such relations that evolves and can be cultivated in parallel to the involuntarily and imperceptibly operating web that we are inherently immersed in"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6avkks9zptcyjt0p12x5b75)

- capitalist, commercialist intent "impedes and gradually obliterates chances for “a singular access to the world” (Berardi, 2014) turning us into mere passive witnesses of the ultimate “colonization of real time” (Lovink, 2011, p.11)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ern6bmfpxyvfg52xwhb9h5)

- traceability - cookies for tracking turned anonymous street-walking flaneury into being stalked/followed

- generally more explicitly political and more explicitly solutions oriented/actionable, more mention of specific movements and orgs, more sources linked, more advanced topics eg post-money economies. more likely to be cross-issue and intersectional

- from [[tactical invisibility]] to "parallel presence"
- "tactics are acts that do not emerge to merely oppose the strategic forces"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3s7ddhamzdmejqw7z4b5ycz)
- "tactics take advantage of these forces by recomposing and reconfiguring their components to serve alternative ends, motivations, and purposes."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3s7dx3naf98ecma5k15vhcz)
- "One becomes a subject not by securing a place outside the reach of power but by shaping one’s subjectivity in critical relation to it” (Verbeek, 2011, p.73)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3s7fmt1jcgydm5bfmrkr8ja)
- "alternative approaches would favor uncertainty, slowness, reflexivity, generosity, multiplicity of attitudes, open-endedness, and process-orientation (ibid., p.151)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4q8g7t8hgx1tv1p6zfa70wn)

- "substantial impoverishment of the modes through which individuals and collectives access and experience the world and effectively construct their account of it on a micro-scale."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ermg7x4pwcnd9t76rg7vjn)

- "tactics no longer appear to be concerned with the desire to disrupt strategies, to temporarily regain or balance power; they themselves take on the role of alternative strategies or para-strategies that operate alongside (and benefit from) what they might have been earlier intended to combat."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3s6zpgjagmz3kcbdpwer30h)

## temporality, impermanence of the feed, moments leaving traces, eternal and infinite present
- ### [[pluriversal temporality]]
- "two different, yet enmeshed relations between data and temporality: their simultaneous flux and sedimentation. Despite features of the timeline which make interaction on Facebook appear as a construction of a durable personal archive, the overriding feeling upon visiting the platform is that of being captivated (and taken captive) by a continuous “flow through the present” (Bogost, 2010, p.28) or an atmosphere of “rapid change and forgetfulness rather than of remembrance and preservation” (Kaun and Stiernstedt, 2014)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ycbz1n02d8vftz76a2n7zc)
- "Consider the constant reminders to capture and share “what is on your mind” along with your “feelings” and “activities” at the moment. If responded to, every such impulse turned into a trace (image, text, or emoticon), while serving as evidence of one’s presence, a particular mark in time, calls for another affective response to ensure one’s sustained presence on top of the flow. However, as argued above, the bedrock of this flow of impulses is where simultaneous, steady accumulation, cataloging, archiving, and distribution of the extracted technovalue take place. As Kember and Zylinska assert, in the context of social media, “‘life itself’ becomes a product, that is constantly remodelled and repackaged"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ycddw6srfkbmjbmph6zf9q)
- "Media technologies that existed once to document and archive the world around us, providing external and physical counterparts to memory, are now designed for different purposes that implicitly recognize the existence of what I refer to as Surf Life. Their intention is to grasp the momentary and immersive, and for reasons that seem to have less to do with posterity – with the archival impulse – than with living in the now (Scanlan, 2013, p.142)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ycec5702ewdhdhyqye8jsb)
- (Snapchat) - "today one can save snapshots as “memories” or “stories” that can be retained for longer periods of time. As the promotional materials for these new features demonstrate, the service is no longer about snapping “ugly,” uninhabited images or engaging in spontaneous communication,"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ydcgkn2cwkv2ef1v05bncq)
- "the question of how such a consistent practice could be conducted in our day, in the age of distraction and “great acceleration” (Colvile, 2016), times that systematically deny us time for reflection."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3s5yj6gr4qx4bdmkq42n0he)
- constant reference to 'flow', 'current' or 'stream' as represented in para-archival practise

- "his definition asserted that technologies “weave themselves,” as opposed to being consciously invited into people’s everyday lives."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y4y4vgw9nakc75y47hbvn2) - but web-weaving as active, weaving as individually selective with the micro-decisions important tactical moments rather than imposed strategy or emergent tactics without human foresight and intent
- 
threaded dialogues?

communication extension - Bringing back the disappearing message format from Snapchat - because it most mimics the real life experience of showing a picture to a friend when you don't want them to keep it, 'for your eyes only' -- but then what of the screenshot experience -- like a 'pls send me this one' option, like if it's cute of my friend. 

- Are.na embeds sometimes do and sometimes don't provide backups - pdfs are on their server but not eg instagram posts or website links
- needs more consistency on whether/what part of content will survive time and technical changes

context of screenshot and context of use eg screenshotting web design vs content

- individual context + individual action/insight = individual path through self-curation
## auto-screenshots, auto-capture generally
- automatic capture leaves no room for attuning to context, only one structure of relations and data
	- "For the potential subject of capture, its automation leaves no room for negotiation and possibility of rejecting (or actively agreeing with) it. For the subject who incorporates the device, this automation, its passive character (and hence a decreased awareness of its working) leave no room for attuning to the specificity of a given social situation. In other words the automated character of the device replaces this specificity with an imposed, pre-defined configuration of relations."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2ytgxw0kee6pa94be5jq8hg
	 - "If, for the life-logger, a wearable, mnemotechnological device is perceived as a fully domesticated companion (to paraphrase Donna Haraway’s term), with regard to others whose everyday trajectories this device inevitably enters this same companion turns into a predator."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yw8qhjmjcct96ehmc5c0s9)
	 - - "the images could function as triggers for imaginative, speculative, playful thinking and acting, as opposed to being seen (as the company would have it) as evidence of the actual and “authentic”, simply because it happens passively."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yrzenvm17ab8s8mdv83g6q)
	- [[applying the general to the specific]]
	- [[unexpected connections]]
---

- indexes of indexes handle mass flood and need for organisation. but lists of lists are authored
	- "The growing role of printing press and movable type in the sixteenth century accelerated the proliferation of textual media, quickly raising a lot of concerns and worries, but also posing challenges to their organization and dissemination. This “book flood” was addressed as a serious problem, calling for new methods to access, organize, and navigate ever more rapidly accumulating written information (Krajewski, 2011, p.9). One early way of tackling this situation was compiling special books that contained meticulously crafted lists of all the volumes in a collection, house, institution or state."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6avtsp02qyjqczvkw7vd05m)
	- "Bibliotheca Universalis was a single-minded archive of all texts available at the time, or, as Markus Krajewski had it, “an index of indexes,” yielding access to a concrete piece of information through a simple, manual “algorithm.”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6avvb8h614rt8cgxv5t49qv)

---

- "invitation to apprehend the notion of the personal differently, not as implying a move inward (protection from the outside and the public), but also (and in today’s media technological landscape, perhaps inevitably) an attentive, reflective, and critical exteriorization of one’s subjecthood into para-archival traces."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0esza4x39abc9wdrktbz4vh)

	- "Thus, the value I find in cultural probing as a specific form of prototyping offered by these authors lies in its ambiguity, modularity, and intentional lack of precision in executing the prototype, as well as its lack of precision in setting forth the aim to be achieved."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4q9te49mvtsjhm0nm6hv4e1) ^f971f6
	- "redefining archiving as not past- but future-oriented practice; not passive, but generative, or even immoderately excessive"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0esqqgqpmyrrdtvp2196wyk)

from practise/findings/analysis
### curation, curation, curation

The variety, cohesion and quality of 'pins' on the selected boards was mixed. It suggested that some people collected with much more conscious curatorial intent than others, who formed larger collections with less cohesion. Purposeful curation is difficult to determine based purely on the content as there can be value to both more and less specificity. I suspect that those with a wider range of sources and kinds of content are curating more actively but see value in both loosely and tightly cohesive collections provided there is a singular thread throughout. Where this veers into purposelessness is in auto-curated collections or those based purely on word association, as this can produce [[false equivalence]] of disparate goals. A clear example of this would be two boards titled 'READ' where one was made to store books that *have been* read and the other to store books the user *wants to* read. 
## simultanaeity
- ambient multi-modal use - eg music playlist or podcast to be listened to whilst browsing the channel - simultaneously experiencing multiple modes
## auto-screenshot-bookmarks
- maybe due to - link rot takes more forms - broken links as on Pinterest, but also broken embeds or outdated frontpage screenshots, very slow-loading embeds, etc
- annotations baked in - screenshots of text used to add highlights/underlines/annotations along with content, or use of pdf embed highlights feature - might want or not want annotation
- still commonly includes Twitter threads, and these more often has provenance/exact date included in image or linked to thread itself. reposts common from Instagram

'desire primary and power secondary.' where? what?

- ### datafied activity, surveillance
	"\[their] involvement in documenting \[their] life becomes a constituent module of this on-going, transactional feedback loop"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0yb1qqy73hw1xbrrxt7fj5x)
	- [[anti~'quantified self']] and [[sousveillance]]
		- "life-logging practices such as \[quantified self] are manifestations of the extensive influence of neo-liberal strategies on people’s everyday lives (Andrejevic, 2014; Boyd and Crawford, 2012)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yp06qrn24ncpn2fcfbe49m)

- ### unclear mechanisms of big tech
	- "become a mechanical component of a larger mnemotechnological mechanism “to which framing and underlying (filtering) mechanisms she or he is not privy” (Chun, 2011 in Emerson, 2013)  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0yb1qqy73hw1xbrrxt7fj5x)
## direct source, full context, allowing multiplicitous interpretation
- "The greatest value of documentary photography, she insisted, was as a source of information, its content, and not the artistic statement, “which is only transitory” (in Łyczywek, 1990, pp.33-37)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3s61p76hrf3v33a3peyf7mh)

	- Maslow, existentialism - the disparity and integration of one’s current and ideal selves, recognizing they're “simultaneously defining characteristics of human nature. Neither can be repudiated; they can only be integrated” quoted in [[quickref#^63f9f1]] - we are always both Being a person and Becoming a person

## being searchable/retrievable makes it archived
- mass data harder to retrieve
- decontextualised data harder to retrieve
- "This insertion of the indexical information turns the captured into the archived"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y35red24kp7et665ces87z)
## archival (or curational) methods can determine capture
- "The acts of capturing and archiving are often inseparable (and in some cases, the capturing, and hence, the captured, are predetermined by the mechanisms of archiving)"  
- "“the technical structure of the archiving archive also determines the structure of the archiveable content even in its very coming into existence and in its relationship to the future. The archivization produces as much as it records the event” (Derrida, 1996, p.17)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yrwfcc2csr9tyz8mar28md)

## capture not inherently for the long-term, not always archival
- "we might primarily intend to capture a moment without considering this act in terms of archiving"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y34fk0xkb6dsgda9hxdanr)
- neither capture nor record has any inherent promise of longevity, both can be temporal
## you can archive captures just as records
- as both captures and records are retrievable, both can be archived (and in web 2.0's technological landscape captures and records often live side-by-side, little distinction between data recorded and data captured due to manual and automatic creation of the same file types)
- "the captured image often becomes part of a larger collection, and since it is labeled and tagged with additional metadata (entered intentionally or inserted automatically)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y357v575r6fxjj6kmbv74d)

- "The analytic threads that connect each of these sections are informed by longstanding questions in visual and cultural studies about the analytic foci or sites where the meanings of an image are made; the site of its production (and orientations of the producers, editors and subjects when they make images); the image itself (how an image is composed and its semiology); and its audiencing (how an image is read by audiences at different historical moments (Fink and Lomax, 2014; Rose, 2016)" from [The SAGE Handbook of Visual Research Methods](https://methods.sagepub.com/hnbk/edvol/the-sage-handbook-of-visual-research-methods-2e/toc)

- Culture as an "emergent property of the relationship between persons and things " (Gravrs-Brown, 2007) RathJe 1979, 2001, 1992; Gould and Schiffer 1981, Holtorf 2004, Finn 2001, Ulin 2009.
- how data blocks are arbitrary, there is actually no singular atomic version because it can be atomic from different viewpoints, is the base just the word or the letter or the byte? different arrangements as per datatype and different even in the analogue world

my work is from the perspective of someone who avoids automatic capture of information wherever possible. The only auto-captures without explicit consent I appreciate are eg evidence of appointments stored for medical/legal/financial reasons, and auto browser history/recently visited - though I'd rather Even have more control over these kinds. Even media watching i prefer to track myself

## physical/spatial memory in object
- "the very technique of collage rather than what is being collated takes precedence in the way that this mnemonic trace is interacted with."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6aj5hmq50k4ep420jqgm1ek)

## open source can be resilient in its modularity
- "But what needs to be mentioned is that in the case of discontinuance of some, there is always a variety of alternatives and replacements available. The field of open-source, freeware and shareware software is wide and one can find often very closely resembling tools that borrow from each other. This is provided that one knows what and where to look for. Thus, this compositional mode of working requires attention to technological developments, and a sustained curiosity, which in return provides a feeling of excitement, vitality and sense of satisfaction contrasting, quite vastly, with a somewhat “programmed” sense of tranquillity or “calmness” that mass-produced, ubiquitous systems are set to provide their users with (Fuller and Matos, 2017, p.181)."

- "(Benjamin, 2003, p.48)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6ajzsn6vs11cyx7191nm41b)
- "To Benjamin, rag-picker constituted an opposite to a bourgeois collector, historian and archivist typically bound to the confines and rules of their professions and institutions. Ignoring the most valuable and historically exceptional, the amateur archivist, or a para-archivist as we might figuratively call a rag-picker, orients himself/herself instead towards the margins of modernity and by-products of its processes. In parallel to his precarious condition, away from any attention, he/she creates a prodigious account of consumerist society’s continual demand for the new (Highmore, 2002, p.61). Certainly, what motivates the rag-picker’s taking to the streets and “botanizing on the asphalt” (Benjamin, 1973) differs radically from the motivation of a conventional collector, historian and archivist."

- "The transposition of rag-picking into a technique of inquiry into material culture is explored (yet not quite completely) in Benjamin’s Arcades Project:
  Like a poor and burdened man cleverly picking through the rubbish of the previous day, the materialist historian selects from amongst all that is disregarded and from the residues of history. At the library he is unconcerned with what has been accredited as precious and valuable, but rather is drawn towards historical refuse. Waste materials are to enter into significant connections and fragments are used to gain a new perspective on history (in Marx et al., 2007, p.252)."

- "seemingly polarized realms, taking place within different societal, cultural and political milieux, trash and what it connotes - the marginal, peripheral, left-over, liminal, circumferential – establish a unifying vector.

## printed ephemera as decentralised archive of software changes

- "While each step modulates the file in a specific way, it also produces particular residue, a kind of digital sawdust that can be retained and possibly re-purposed further on. This production of the sawdust can be seen as a manifestation of a certain (perhaps continuously minimal, yet detectable) degree of technical transparency (understood in-line with the meaning rooted in the pre-web 2.0), gradually disappearing today in favour of user friendly technological systems promising seamless and clean experiences. The digital sawdust is hence an evidence that accounts for a process that takes place. In contrast to meta-data or other contextual data scraped by imperceptible algorithms that process memories as in the case of large scale mnemotechnological systems, this sawdust does not become completely disclosed or instantly hidden. For instance, since much of the process takes place locally, on my computer, I can keep the numeric data from the first phase of the process"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6ajga3gpx2ss7ar39mdhz1q)

- "I have had the privilege of working on a doc- toral thesis which, from the beginning, I intended to correspond with my on-going, creative work. I often pondered how to bring it into the research context.

- "he third part of this practice-based study follows the process of making the fragmentarium, a hybrid media cabinet, comprised of digital and non-digital traces from my recording practices. This part of practical work is inspired by a method of reverse-remediation which creates a ground for speculating on possibilities for more autonomous and reflective approach to crafting and organizing one’s mnemonic legacy in light of the accelerating digitization and technical management of every detail of personal and social life. This exploration begins with another turn towards the past, this time to some pre-digital forms and material practices involved in the organization of personal archives. While producing this hybrid-media cabinet and its digital substructure, I explore the material, temporal and performative aspects with a particular focus on the notion of hybridity. This exploration allows me to establish a closer link between para-archiving and the concept of the post-digital, and subsequently, to problematize this hybrid media approach to personal memory and archiving as a critical and productive mode for establishing a parallel zone for operating in capture culture."

In this section I discuss fragmentarium club as a collective mode of para-archiving that, while invoking the spirit of amateur recording clubs is also debated as a potential, experiential mode of constructively re-articulating relation- ships with capturing technologies and approaching the record of every- day life in the context of capture culture."

## short-term vs long-term explicit discussion
- disconnect from archival purpose and reason for capture - eg the short-term and long-term purpose of 'stories' and similar 
	- "Facebook and Snapchat might be seen as an example of an instant archive with no long-term, cultural, and historical significance beyond the very moment of their production and consumption"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yvt1er106yr2vjwj55vsw0)

## on semantics and temporality
- the digital archive "evades the confines of chronology and semantics as the primary criteria for organizing, mediating, and accessing information, producing "micro-temporary experiences of time that strongly defy any fixed order."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0esh33vtybw9tevdtwcfr7d). I'd argue that access to temporality and to semantics should be sliding-scale, as different data has different cadence, weight, etc in terms of meaning. semantics Should be held in digital form and some idea of content age can be useful. flat ontology doesn't mean each individual in capturing or storing that data has an atemporal, meaning-ambivalent connection to it. 
## a model for temporal contextual information and its use, re-use, etc.
- logging as future-oriented but also contextual, specific and task-oriented
	- "log-books served as a navigational technique for sailors."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yqctwgeqz1fqnky2f6c2qp)
	- "The consistent logging of data allowed for a better assessment of a journey’s progress towards its destination."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yqd8n1603e15t7mzpcg4vk)
	- "In this light, the very term “log” in life-logging points toward this practice’s inherent orientation toward progress, and hence the future, making it radically unlike how one traditionally perceives personal archiving."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yqdmz0hvh325750wv8eemh)
	 - it is inherently capturing data in order to make changes - but is also inherently missing too much data when ignoring any qualitative insight
	- "log-books used to have time-limited value."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yqg4t5fmbgq6pcc393qh34) - temporal, fleeting notes
	- "representative and useful in relation to a particular journey"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yqhnths30d0xwtn1cfgpff)
- contextualisation and decontextualization
	 - but some is relevant to that journey at that time, and some relevant to that journey as may be repeated/replicated
	- "once that journey was completed, the log-book would lose its significance and function"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yqjw4fc687s5g22s6e5t33)
	- "Maury studied a vast collection of abandoned, seemingly useless old ships’ logs. He developed a method for retrieving the most important information from each log-book, for example, the speed and weather conditions. Compiled and unified, these different streams of information were then used for making highly informative maps for navy and merchant ships"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yqknda40ekvc0wvnq1jfvp)
	 - someone's trash is someone else's treasure - data recycling, resummarising, etc. hard to do in one shot as each summary has a different focus, but raw data might be overly contextual and not still useful as a whole or too personal
	- example, Nazi camp images
		- "A tall man points his small camera at an internal officer, probably unaware of being photographed (Fig. 5.4). At the first glance this strong depiction seems to quite literally express the dynamics of souveillance: a subjugated individual confronting one of the agents of the oppressive force. But beyond the stratum established by this first association there lies a thicker, contextual texture. The man with a camera on the picture was Mendel Grossman, an amateur photographer appointed by the ghetto’s Judenrat (the Jewish Administration Office) to work in its statistics department.51 Grossman’s official job, acquired due to his photographic skills, was to photograph ghetto inhabitants for official archival and statistical purposes."

[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3s2hs59rhp2k3kh707xjpkg)

## alt-academia


- "(Law, 2004, p.45). If methods are typically aids for analyzing an aspect of the world, as Law asserts, they might also work against such a belief. Methods might even block the researcher from being open to the world, limiting his/her ability to note and reflect upon pre-established norms. In Law’s words:
	-   If ‘research methods’ are allowed to claim methodological hegemony or (even worse) monopoly, and I think that there are locations where they try to do this, then when we are put into relation with such methods we are being placed, however rebelliously, in a set of constraining normative blinkers. We are being told how we must see and what we must do when we investigate (ibid., p.4)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4q8d43rwprs8zckdmd2vsny)


- "method as “not a more or less successful set of procedures for reporting on a given reality,” but always a “performative” act, and consequently, a support that helps not to reveal, but “to produce realities” (ibid., p.143). Thus, the shift he proposes can be seen as a move from a method as a reporting procedure (or device) toward a generative, productive and performative act."

Method assemblage sees the field of study as subject to constant flux, a never stable, and fully accountable field of relations. A grasp of this field is always only partial and subjective."

- does it have to inherently retain personal value to be para-archival? or to retain public value?

## i'd argue the agency and interpretations makes it para-archival, not its potential legacy - [[archival legacy]] - legacy a common theme in are.na meta-blocks too
- "what makes an everyday recording practice a candidate for para-archiving is a certain awareness, vision, and anticipation that the record one deliberately produces parallel to one’s life and eventually leaves behind might hold special significance in the future."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3s6nxked1cvswmtck01a0qm)

## addressable data as multi-scalar archive
- "all digital content (digital image, video, sound file) is in itself a kind of (techno-)archive (Wolfgang Ernst, 2013). Since a single digital file consists of a set of alphanumeric characters, every such character, frame or even a pixel can be discretely addressed and recalled, just like a properly indexed document stored in a traditional archive."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y36y5rqphpdwyxj9cdt5mj)


## permanence
- [[impermanent memory isn't inherently undesirable]]

- coding self-documents/leaves residue
    - "for a retention of not only the successful and functional command lines but also elements of left-over code, dysfunctional remnants such as symbols, sequences, annotations to oneself “commented out”, which is to say put on hold in terms of their effectiveness for the time being. 
    - The programmed artifact hence becomes simultaneously a residue, or a record of steps taken along the way, while obviously acquiring its intended function of a repository and structuring device for organization and display of digitized content."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6ajse551nszxx3hz4en0v49)
    - not only self-documenting and self-exemplifying but also self-archiving in a way, self-reflecting

- "Parikka builds a connection between seventeenth-century instruments for secret writing (such as Athanasius Kirchner’s Arca Steganographica) and contemporary forms of inscribing digital files with content beyond one’s percep- tion. Not only hidden messages, personal data, but also malicious bits of code can be steganographically inscribed into a digital file, o"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3r8530a9dn362az7acs3bq7)
 - find that paper on viruses in Pins

[[data obfuscation]]
-  similar to how a single mode of subversive text amongst garbage metadata might be obfuscating the message as a subversive act - ie should we make Pinterest MORE messy to singularly direct to other methods? but is this necessarily exclusive and environment damaging and brain overloading?

This term can be defined as the “internal manipulations of a system” (1984, p.25). If, as said before, every cultural epoch can be characterized by the dominance of technical systems that establish particular regimes, limitations, and norms defining the status of the individual and collective (ibid, p.XXIII), it can also be characterized by various practices that use the ever-existing possibility to shift and re-combine the elements of this system for another, alternative purpose:"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0erwqssytpdwp0d6epqwhjr)

- "subscribing to and opting out of network services, social platforms, and their capturing mechanisms is no longer an option in capture culture. Consequently, as Kember has argued, paranoia “is an understandable but ultimately unhelpful response to our increasingly naturalized, insidious (because user-friendly) technologies of everyday control” (Kember, 2014, p.17)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yw24xw2477zja9y891act3)

## subjective media messaging
- "to Kember and Zylinska, mediation is “the originary process of media emergence with media being seen as (ongoing) stabilizations of the media flow” (ibid., p.21). This means that media do not necessarily establish some large scale fixed relationships, but can as such become subject to temporary and micro-level alterations and stabilizations. Mediation can be seen as an active creation and recombination of relations between always already entangled human and non-human, media technological entities. Mediation is where a sustenance and negotiation of the relationship between them happens. It can become stabilized and form always particular, temporal milieux that are exemplary to these enactments. It is evident that in such a reading the terms media and mediation are long departed from their connotations to institutions, objects and texts, and subsequently lend themselves to be read and articulated better as sites, temporalities, processes and performances."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0pwh3mmcpyrc42mnw6n8yva)
- "approach media as something that happens or is enacted through a particularly situated practice"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0pwj0q82vcvxs8g34tqgw8m)
- "Rather than looking at mediation as an “implied conversation” constrained by existing media infrastructures, he suggested that “it may be more productive to see mediation as capturing a variety of dynamics within media flows” (Couldry, 2008, p.380). In other words, Couldry proposed to step away from considering the subtleties of mediation as a being strictly compelled to stabilities of a larger media world and its institutions operating above the layer of everyday life."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0pwjvrrn002j7p2cq7z7kxq)
- "individuals continuously intervene into its dynamics, introduce “non-linearity”, “discontinuity” and “asymmetry” into its flow (Couldry, 2008, p.381). Though while by saying that, his proposition paradoxically protracts the validity of these fixed realms, as they are continuously prerequisite to these said interventions to occur. In other words, Couldry’s understanding of mediation while letting us move from directly addressing media effects they produce toward dynamics of media flows across various practices emerging between these stabilities, at the same time, implicitly adheres to their continuous working."

 - "In ancient times it was commonly believed that the heart, not the mind, was the seat of memory. Aristotle, for example, considered the heart to be the base of intelligence and the brain a “cooling” device, an instrument that controlled and rationalized the processes of the heart (Gross, 1995). The phrase “learning by heart” is a significant remnant of this belief."[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y2hjttvg94pyhebv5be61g)

- "By the term “data sweat” I mean the refuse and by product of mundane digital interactions; the term has been discussed much more thoroughly by Melissa Gregg (Gregg, 2015). Data sweat is a byproduct of a digitally augmented body, always seen as a somewhat porous entity unable to fully control the streams of data it produces."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y4t57j8bwd5wncn9yqfrcb)
- "Kessel conjures up the material dimension of the allegedly immaterial practice of digital data production. The project reminds us that, despite a serious reconfiguration of its material substrate (from a paper coated with a light-sensitive formula of chemicals, to time-sensitive, imperceptibly operating networks of transistors and capacitors of “microtemporalities,” as Wolfgang Ernst describes the new units that constitute the dynamics of digital culture and memory \[2013, p.70]), digital photography, like any other data collection practice, remains a material practice.

- "Verbeek (2011) argues that, if technologies are externalizations of the human conscience, then certain norms and principles of behavior are always implicitly or explicitly materialized in them. That means that technology exerts a certain moral influence on human beings, which is to say, it adjusts their behavior according to pre-programmed guidelines"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yttqs4jxmv5gjp6y3w5hj9)
 - in the case of AI this is often tweaking to an original goal, which, even if it is 'to help the human using it' it could result in a lot of actually very unhelpful things
 - "Krajewski reminds us that chance and random encounters with books, strolling through the aisles of libraries, were also common modes of browsing and gaining knowledge, before they were organized in accordance with complex classification systems (Krajewski, 2011, p.32). The eighteenth century marks the time when the organization of knowledge migrated from bound pages of books and catalogs to loosely compiled, individual index cards, enabling multiple ways of navigating a collection of books. Simultaneously, however, this moment can be seen as initiating a more rigorous management of knowledge and collective memory, a more disciplined control over their production, rationalization, systematization, and dissemination. It was also around that time that, as Krajewski argues, “the library becomes a bearer of capital, a data bank, lending information as if it were credit” (ibid., p.24)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6awktpa8ah1ad85svzsxxc6)

## more automated, less control, more standardized
- "Similarly, the manual ability to operate a camera, or the ability to write and comprehend a code (where both can be seen as more attentive techniques, or, as Stiegler puts it, the “know-how” of living with technologies) have gradually made way for more automated, sometimes over-simplified technological habits (e.g. effortlessly applicable visual filters imitating the results of manual photography, standardized, readymade templates for organizing one’s personal data without the need to engage in programming and coding)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y20pxdbmjdnwwc662yggyh)

## writing an aid not to memory but to reminisce - subjective views, leaving a trace
- "The specific which you have discovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence and you give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company having the show of wisdom without the reality (in Deuze, 2012, p.115)."

- "a unit of communication in a spontaneous and unscripted dialog (or chat), which, after being externalized, vanishes from the field of perception, remaining only in the memory of those in the conversation (cf. anemnesis in Plato’s dialogs). This ephemerality of snapshots intensified the production of snapshots to an unprecedented scale, incomparable with any other social platform."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ychp2rj1kq0yxq039jnz12)
- "Even though users believed their photos on Snapchat were not being stored and archived, it was relatively easy to save them, using photo capturing technology, third party applications, or simple screen-shots, for example; from there they were circulated again either within or outside the Snapchat framework. With a few simple manipulations by the user, the non-archival incentive of the service could be practically defeated. It has also been proven that even on a technical level Snapchat images do not fully disappear; instead, they might constitute involuntary archives."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0ydae0vtaw4qx5cb1rtt1yc)
- "what we and our senses construe as deletion and erasure, the operating system might perceive as a specific mode of archiving, or as Ernst would have it, dynarchiving, in which a collapse of erasing and storing procedures is a prerequisite to any operation concerned with the registration and mediation of digital memory (Ernst, 2013, pp.90-94), and, as seen here, its destruction."

## oral memory, oral conversational technique
- "Before mechanized voice-recording capabilities were introduced, poetic devices such as rhymes, rhythms, and, more generally, the craft and organization speech in time were deliberately used as techniques to facilitate memorizing and transmitting knowledge;"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y1d99y8enf8a5vb3sxt036)
- "The transformation of memory practices from techniques of poetry, invention, and creativity into mechanized and then industrialized production of knowledge can be identified by moving back to the Renaissance, when techniques known literally as the art of memory (from Latin ars memoriae) were overshadowed by a mechanical means of processing memory, such as the printing press. Historically, the ancient practice of ars memoriae involved training one’s memory, recall, and creative thinking by assigning particular symbols, vivid images (Carruthers, 2008, p.186), imaginary architectural structures, and monuments to one’s thoughts11. The highly inventive and performative practices of ars memoriae were based on actively tending to memory, spatializing it, and constructing its inventory by breaking it down into discrete expressions and projecting them onto either imagined or real parts of the environment. In medieval times, the principles of the ancient ars memoriae were adopted to monastic traditions of meditation and mindfulness. With the revival of interest in Aristotle’s writings, such mnemotechniques re-emerged in the Renaissance as a kind of art of designing idiosyncratic, visual systems, illustrations, or arrangements combining numbers, letters, and astrological symbols, for establishing different relationships to produce new thoughts and meanings."

- "growing number of amateur photographers became coordinated and synchronized in response to standardized surveys developed by archival and heritage institutions. These surveys would typically indicate what to pay attention to and how to photograph it. This would ultimately make the analysis and cataloging of the material easier for the institution. One subject of such surveys discussed in “The Camera as a Historian” is the decomposition of nineteenth-century lifestyles, landscapes, and practices affected by industrialization and modernization. There is, however, something paradoxical in the utilization of mass-produced cameras to such ends. While it can be seen as a nostalgic attempt to freeze and catalog specific aspects of the disappearing reality of the nineteenth century, one can also look at this systematic deployment of portable, mass-produced cameras – themselves products of modernization, industrialization and scientific management – as a critical apprehension of the consequences of these very processes. Thus, despite being influenced by the objectives of a superior authority, such focused practices of amateur archiving also emerge as a site for the potential development and alteration of historical awareness and subjectivity."

- "In order to maintain the status of the archive as a legitimate source of historical knowledge, archivists and historians had no choice but to embrace the multiplicity of viewpoints from which new kinds of visual records could be constructed. " [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y3wwzy0891a875s0xheac1)
- "While historians and archivists advocated the incorporation of amateur photography into the (mass-)production of cultural heritage through a kind of distributed mass surveyance (note the connotation between surveying and surveilling),"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y4n88c00k4jds1n5mxg7r0)


## time is subjective 
- that Butcher's crossing quote time you can 'crumple up into a ball and throw away'
- "around the fragmentation of everyday life experience, reduction of space to key representative sites (as in the case of tourists maps) and acceleration of time (and lifestyle) expressed in maps picked up at train and bus terminals on which distances between locations are often synthesized and shrunk"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6aj8fk9erx83zh7e938cx1z)
- [[abstraction is necessarily reductive]]
- "the arbitrariness and incompatibility of the automated capture with my personal impressions and memory, and the second to ethical concerns around the infringement of privacy and power dynamics in everyday life."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yrmsqaekqsecfsr9sk3gm6)
- "static position shots stand a better chance of being captured than brief, dynamic movements and spontaneous, passing gestures. While my memory would usually retain the latter type of a situation (for instance, rushing to school on a bicycle in the rain, or my body doubling over in laughter) the automated sequence-based method of capturing and structuring the archive privileges and saturates the visibility of static situations. Consequently, the archive presents them as seemingly more important events, at the expense of passing, sudden situations."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yrqqz8f3hd1tercgwadwce)
- "automatically organized by the software that comes with the wearable camera makes me feel as if I were looking not at or into the events of my life as I have experienced them, but into a parallel life happening right alongside"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yrrhapp8trnerdcdag4xxj) - "represents not the life of its owner, but the life of the device"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yrs95rnxj14zew0bvtk2sa) - supposed objectivity is just that, object-ivity
- "the archive aggregated by this life-logging device promises to be objective, accurate, and, as the website suggests, “authentic,”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yrtz412f08b2zmz72343j6)
 - not every 30 seconds is equally important and we don't experience time this way
- "It does not secure the ephemerality and value of “moments that matter,” but instead constructs traces of these moments."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yrvtvz4sjrbpx8d538wkyz)
- "a sense of dissociation between myself and the captured memory"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yrxq4ms5cx066e83fyh7eq)
- "The camera’s mnemonic trace occasionally coincides with my memories, though it feels like most of the time, while occupying the same space, my memory and the device’s seem asynchronous."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2yryqtc30ze0t82dpr0yc9t)
- "living “through” the events of the everyday, erlebnis, which replaced a mode of experiencing everyday life that can be attentively accumulated, critically reflected upon, and transposed into knowledge: erfahrung (Benjamin, 1969). In other words, aided by the growing abundance of mechanized technologies, modernity seemed to have shrunk the sensation of time and space, radically contesting the possibility for long-term knowledge accumulation and replacing it with the necessity to deal with and manage a continuous exposition to shocks, or as Claire Colebrook would call it, a glut of instantaneous affects (Colebrook, 2014, p.86) that promises nothing more than a sense of temporary satisfaction, followed by exhaustion. The amplification of this transformation from erfahrung to erlebnis, from caring for and cultivating one’s observational skills and opinions toward mechanically managing a multitude of shortterm shocks and affects, echoes in the trajectory of contemporary technological developments programmed toward quantity instead of quality."

- anti-[['luddism']], pro-[[anti-exploitative luddism|luddism]] -- mnemotechnology not inherently worse than mnemotechnique, just needs to be adopted with enough purpose and foresight, integrate and resist appropriately [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0y1yhdy0gjx2apxcnr0vfpv)
- misquoting interesting for remix but also the active subversion implicit - remix can thwart original intent, knowledge lineage needs to include who opposes each other
- Experiential knowledge can be considered fragmented and multi-modal due to the constant input from multiple senses across time. It can also be considered as a mode of resistance for marginalised voices. Works in this area skew towards historical counter-memory, whilst I'm also highlighting more directly functional knowledge of process and advice, where the past can be instrumentalised for the present to build alternative futures. This research concerns fragmented experiences captured, stored and shared online. In referring to 'fragments' of arbitrary scale I emphasise their capacity for re- and de- composition over their specific form.
- Are.na roadmap - BTW 'Search: intelligent image tagging' is this AI or obj recog or something??
- individual complex setups with a million custom scripts and integrations, we are looking for a flexible base that interfaces the simplest setup well 
- more participatory methods fit well with my goals but I didn't have enough time to do it properly
