content analysis of case studies

in selecting I also identified how each board
a) fits existing theories of Pinterest use
b) goes against existing theories of Pinterest use
c) expands existing theories of Pinterest use

largely fit theories of
- mixed usage, personal and political
- thematic or conceptual or purpose-driven boards
- future, dreaming, hoping, wishing

contradicting by
- not being aesthetic focused/image-first

and expanding by
- being well-sourced/well-linked (dedicated use as well as casual)
- linking directly to free content (non-commercial)
- resources for diverse topics (not just craft)

then analyse Pins directly
then exemplify each category of Pin I identify

in selecting channels I identified how each channel
a) fits my expanded theories of Pinterest use
b) expands what is possible on Pinterest through more content types
c) differs due to possible demographic/structural/purpose difference
