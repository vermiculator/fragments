- self-exemplifying
- para-tactics
	- [[slow tactics|para-tactics]] -  “inventive employment of possibilities within strategic circumstances” (Highmore, 2002, p.159).
- connective
- non-linear assemblage
- challenging the role of the institution in knowledge-making
- liveness, evolving form
- i need to do it all
	- - i needed more room. this thesis is the first long-prose piece of a wider body of work covering my academic interests - it needed to be able to record more content as it expands in a way that respects the process of further learning and discovery - i'm working experimentally as is part of my wider interest in experimental publishing and respect for the kinds of knowledge that aren't (or can't be) captured in a thesis format or a strict word count, and so i must pay homage to this whilst simultaneously fulfilling requirements for the main text to fit within the boundaries of the institution. 
	- expansive nature of connecting my thesis as a part of and inextricably linked with my general note base - this has allowed me to expand informally - connect more of the research process and surrounding works without fully exploring and explaining it in the main body of the thesis
- masters in public - working in public 
- personal is political, research is political, research is personal. 
	- writing this thesis is inextricably tangled with writing the narrative of my professional journey and my socio-political education. it has to be too personal and all-encompassing
- audience - I have to both write for myself by default and also provide doorways and linear paths through it. - that thing abt how museums do that
- dogfooding
- [[experimental publishing as collective struggle]] 
- this site exists as "a mobile provotype", "provoking reflection on alternate modes of personal archives, and post-digital memory practices."  [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
- [[code self-exemplifies and self-documents]]
- it also gives me room to write in a mixture of styles according to how it flows in the moment. communicating the full scope of my experience has always been hard for me ([[autism]]) and I'm working on allowing the full scope of that to be shared rather than shutting it all down and self-isolating. 
- i need to be able to put my fleeting notes beside a multiply-edited concise thesis and for that to be ok, and make sense, and all form an assemblage useful first for me and secondarily for others very similar to me and tertiary for everyone else
- if my assertion is that assembled fragments of knowledge can contribute to social change, then my alternative thesis format as assembled fragments can challenge the role of the institution in knowledge-making
