The kind of content I've been more interested in here is the kind that a) is primarily functional, saved for the source link or metadata, b) diagrammatic, visual but also instrumental, c) aesthetically-minded display of quotes, snippets,  slogans, other textual information, d) visuals or visuals + text that tell stories of past resistance and e) visuals of eco-techno-utopias and similar clear alternative visions of the future (resisting oppressive dominant narratives). These vague groupings have naturally emerged from my habitual curiosity as a casual user of the platforms, and following data analysis they'll be more clearly defined. I want to discuss what it is that makes this infrastructure useful for future-building (TODO - discuss self-realisation and self-transcendence). To this end I've used a fluid list of key [[search terms]] to uncover relevant boards and channels on Pinterest and Are.na respectively.
