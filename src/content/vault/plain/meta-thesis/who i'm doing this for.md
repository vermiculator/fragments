- me
-  not just institutional 'students' of specific topic but 'students' of everything
- not designers, professionals, but laypeople, everyday creatives and activists and value-driven people
- self-taught and self-teaching, self-practising
- queer people, neurodivergent people, mentally ill and disabled people
- chronically ill, burnt out, low-energy, stressed and depressed people
- those pursuing technologies of assistance
- those pursuing tools for change
- leftist, politically inclined (whether they know it or not)
- marginalised people of various kinds- those facing intersectional oppressions
- anyone trying to bottom-up bootstrap change through a combination of barriers
- most specifically, the strong contingent of leftist, queer, neurodivergent people who use internet/smartphones/laptops/tablets as tools for thought and impetus for change
- Tumblr and TikTok leftists I've hovered around
- ==for those trying to work through foggy brain to turn values into lifestyle/career/activism/social change.==
