I used keyword-search and snowball sampling methods for selection of boards/pins on Pinterest and channels/blocks on Are.na, for purposive sampling. I selected and excluded based on the following criteria:

| criteria                                                                                              | platform          | selection           | justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

snowball sampling and purposive sampling in general can have its biases but here i felt it was fitting due to the meta-nature of this thesis and its focus on linked knowledges: if my claims are true about these platforms and their affordances, there Should be relevant data points connected to each other in this way. 

there are similarities ad differences in sampling in this way on each platform. There may be issues of redundancy with both where i route from one pin/block to another channel as it then structurally must be one containing that same pin/block. There also may be missing data points from connections not made or adjacent channels/boards whose titles are too obscure for me to have connected them conceptually on initial keyword generation. The differing infrastructure and cultures of these sites may have influenced the sampling in regards to how their search algorithms surface new content and how likely users are to make relevant connections. 

These issues I see as minor due to the nature of my analysis - I'm treating these boards/channels more as case studies of themes developed from my prior casual experiences on the platforms and from the theories I'm framing this work with. This is not intended as a comprehensive analysis of all usage behaviours on either of these platforms but as evidencing principled design decisions ill be making in the development process.
