## Assemblage analysis

### [[Pinterest analysis details|Analysis of Pinterest boards]]

^16c282
#### hyperconnected para-archives

Pinterest held more evidence of hyperconnected knowledge than I expected. I found **instructional diagrams** linked to relevant resources, historical claims and quotes connected to **primary sources** or secondary resources linked through **Tumblr threads of gold**. In descriptions, titles, watermarks and comments there were creative acts of resisting the site's capital-oriented architecture through additional provenance, **directly actionable** pins and **gateways** to alternative communities. This appropriation of tools can be considered para-tactical assemblage of **para-archives**.

#### source link semantics

^73d764

Pinterest's 'source' link as [[provenance]] is necessary to determine [[trust]] with historical reference such as protest images shared amongst mis/disinformation and AI-generated images. Other media would benefit from, but do not rely on, connection to an arbitrary number of sources. Meme analysis in the context of resistive fragment assemblages could be illuminating but is beyond the scope of this analysis. Reposted content with a source link may be facsimile of a knowledge lineage but in practise obscures original sources. To contrast, Tumblr's interface separates straightforward reblogs from those that add additional content.

#### image-first infrastructure

A particularly interesting circumvention of the image-first infrastructure was the use of **image as data** in the form of visual book lists, book covers and spines. Research is ongoing within library sciences to connect metadata with images of shelves (Zhou et al., 2022) which could be extended over these networks to associate predictable image forms. Many pins contained fragments of text within them, raising the question of [[what counts as an atomic fragment]]. I found a strong presence of **decorated text-blocks** and **slogans** from which the primary content is easily 'scraped', but the formatting might provide important context. Screenshots particularly often hold metadata and provenance. I'll [[plain/thesis/thesis-practise#^72fb09||discuss later]] the value of viewing these fragments both [[contextualised and decontextualised fragments are both useful|contextualised and decontextualised]].

![[wrong format.png]]

#### forms of resistance

Much of the resistive content in these assemblages came from **actionable utopias** (creation, development, building, doing) and **actionable dystopias** (destruction, dismantling, abolition, undoing). In **connecting past, present and future** users were able to articulate visions of collective futures, often by **making sense/nonsense** (denaturalisation, cartharcism, confusions, absurdism and existentialism), bringing attention to complexities of socio-economic-political climates. I interpreted content variously as **counter-strategy**, **counter-tactics** or a blurring of the two, as discussed in depth by Smolicki [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(2017)]] in his articulation of para-archival tactics. Much of this could also be interpreted as **self actualisation** and **self-transcendence**, where messaging focused on the long-term capacity-building of individuals, groups and communities.
##### vagueposting revolution

A notable class of pins used irony, humour, vague language or appeal to in-group language to discuss incendiary political acts. Softened threats and speaking through others (screencap captions, gifs) dissociated posters from the acts described. Whilst catharcism like this is common and pinning doesn't necessarily entail engaging with the content to make change [[library/Just Pin It Understanding the Dynamics of Pinterest Use, Motivation, Self-Efficacy, and Health Behaviors|(Dolphin, Char, and Rogers, 2024)]], this ambiguity enables a resistive counter-public that retains denial of intent or purpose. Signalling directly and indirectly to multiple audiences at once allows resistive unity without the specifics that individualise and identify authors - another benefit of [[decontextualised over contextualised fragments|decontextualisation]].

### Analysis of [[plain/meta-thesis/Are.na analysis|Are.na]] channels

^b866b9

#### rich, multi-modal linked data

Are.na's infrastructure echoes Tumblr's multi-modality [[tumblr (book)|(Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021)]]. Text blocks precipitate additional patterns of use to Pinterest's, such as [[excerpting]] and journaling. Saving PDFs is of huge microcultural and infrastructural significance as Are.na also now functions as a searchable textual archive. Allowing capture of a raw url is another benefit of this [[multi-modal|multi-modality]]. Both Are.na and Pinterest's bookmarks insist on an image cover, an uncommon pattern in bookmarking which [[refinding is quicker from images than text|can be useful for refinding]] [[Screenshot Situations|(Tyżlik-Carver, 2022)]], but in aggregate produces redundant visual clutter of auto-screenshots. I determined that Are.na's bookmarks covered common categories: organisations, articles, resources and temporal bookmarks. Resource bookmarks would've often been more useful as embedded lists of links but sometimes included web tools or unusual formats. Temporal bookmarks were those with associated dates and deadlines: bookmarks never intended to persist.

<ArenaEmbed id="10305629"></ArenaEmbed>

#### knowledge lineage and reflexive curation

Whilst Are.na stores only a single source link as Pinterest does, its culture encourages added provenance in the text body, title, descriptions or comments, to a greater degree than Pinterest. In text blocks, users often quote or take excerpts from longer articles, which act as **general inspiration** on Pinterest (CITE) but contain **reflexive commentary** on Are.na. Many channels are designed explicitly around a titular questions, as study guides or with **embedded navigational instructions**. Are.na's culture of connectivity and methods of capture encourage [[citational justice]]. 

<iframe style="border:none;" width="100%" height="590" src="https://www.are.na/block/10340425" title="embedded Are.na block"></iframe>
<caption>In quoting an article reviewing another work, source lineage is preserved but obscured by displaying it as plain text without quotation - a minor interface choice that confuses the authorship and intent of individual fragments when assembled.</caption>

#### forms of resistance
Content on Are.na was more likely to indicate **earnest exploration** of a topic, with less representation of memes, slogans and humour and more straight-forward information. Much of the content was **hopeful**, **action-focused** and **esoteric**, reflecting both [[plain/thesis/thesis-practise#^9c0db3|the user base]] and the affordances of [[multi-modal|multi-modality]]. Reference to **collective responsibility** was more explicit and use of the platform often felt more deliberate and reflexive, leading me to further analysis through users' meta-commentary. 


<iframe style="border:none;" width="100%" height="590" src="https://www.are.na/block/785725" title="embedded Are.na block"></iframe>


## [[Are.na meta-analysis]]

With great capacity for **texture and liveness** through embedded elements of 'vibrant media' (CITE), Are.na appears to be most useful in extra-institutional and creative research. Cobb (2010) describes learning as "becoming a curator for that area"; "In a sense, this is what academics have always done." (Cobb, 2010, no pagination). Are.na emerges as **alt-academia** for those with interests too specific, creative or transdisciplinary to pertain to traditional methods. These experimental digital practises position Are.na as a **new underground** - a diverse, engaged community pursuing the **esoteric**, or a series of connected fragment assemblages forming their own [[counter-publics|counter-public]] of **friendly strangers**. Many users held the sentiment that Are.na constitutes the "[Good Internet](https://www.are.na/block/6628392/)", with the **lo-fi** ethos and **no noise** making space for "[digital intimacy](https://www.are.na/block/8028046)".

Are.na users value the **multi-modality** of the platform, perhaps as it affords "respect for the multifaceted complexity of memory as opposed to one technical grid applied to all types of memories and observations." [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.102)]]. Juxtaposing [[embodied knowledge|embodied]], [[experiential knowledge|experiential]] knowledges with traditional sources provide reflexive space in its reconfiguration [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]]. Whilst some **hoarding** of blocks resembles "nothing more than collection" (Wolff and Mulholland, 2013, no pagination), Are.na users often describe **curation** as defined prior by **deliberate organisation** or collection along specific themes. Many users contrasted it with Pinterest directly.

Further to this, I found my own impressions echoed by those who viewed their Are.na usage as a maturation of their time on Tumblr (["post-Tumblr"](https://www.are.na/block/17029606), ["tumblr graduation"](https://www.are.na/block/13297652/)). Tumblr's sense of **intimacy** alongside a "pedagogy for social change" [[tumblr (book)|(Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021, pp.135)]] is evident also on Are.na. In interviews exploring later changes to the platform, a Tumblr user shared: "I miss a space where I could explore and construct a juxtapositional, incoherent, multifaceted version of myself...a particular engaged, kind audience...a space where I contained multitudes" [[tumblr (book)|(Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021)]]. It appears that Are.na is one such space.

### (hyper)active exploratory agency

^cddc06


<iframe style="border:none;" width="100%" height="590" src="https://www.are.na/block/769369/" title="embedded Are.na block"></iframe>

Many established themes covered cases of organizing (and 'deorganizing') content, balancing the freedoms of extensibility with the usability of minimal interfaces. I'd argue that Are.na users overestimate how reconfigurable their content is on this platform due to structural limitations I'll discuss [[plain/thesis/thesis-practise#^7b77d2|later]]. Are.na benefits greatly from comparison to more prohibitive tools, but it's overarching structural success is in its **multi-directional connectivity** that allows for representation of [[knowledge graphs]]. I found that **flexibility** alone is a surprisingly common draw, perhaps as it reflects a non-persistent selfhood "exposed in media, \[forming] realities or identities that can be accessed, shaped, and continuously re-edited" [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.63)]].

How users conceptualise their freedoms, however limited, is of great interest here. Overwhelmingly, users exclaim **[[active decision-making for regaining agency under controlling structures|active agency]]** in curating their own 'channels' of content. There's a strong preference for **[[slow labour]]**, supporting the literature on active, manual curation. Users explicitly express that they are **anti-AI**, **anti-algorithm** and **anti-ad**, or more widely that they feel **in control** on this platform. 

I describe it as **(hyper)active** in a nod to neurodivergent 'special interests' or hyperfixations; Are.na's structure encourages **rabbitholes** and **trails** of information-seeking on niche topics (["hunting for truffles in a forest"](https://www.are.na/block/17029606)) and its users often self-identify as **nerds and techies** who are **chasing a high**.^9c0db3

The exploratory agency is well supported by access to multiple formats, **open source processes** and opportunity for subversive or alternative personal practises. Users commonly share indexes with codes, icons and keywords imposing personal structure over the default **flat ontology**. People who use and comment on Are.na as a collective call for "selectivity as opposed to totality" [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.102)]] in what is captured, for quality connections and reflections rather than **hoarding** behaviours. The design implication here is to not enforce one singular method of interaction, and to exclude from consideration more automated forms of curation such as those employed lately by Pinterest [(Newsroom, 2025)](https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en-gb/news/introducing-auto-collages-shopping-and-trend-forecasting-cannes-2025/). As discussed [[plain/thesis/thesis-context#^f3c77f|prior]], it is in the active decisions over including, excluding, labelling and recombining fragments that their human impact is felt. Are.na is built as mnemotechnology, but it encourages mnemotechniques (**practises and rituals**) to develop that may extend beyond the platform.
### everything everywhere all at once

^cdd9bb

The most prevalent theme in my Are.na meta-analysis spoke directly to the infrastructure. Many users saw Are.na as **porta(b)l(e) memory** - a **portal** to their externalised memory that is also **portable**. 

Are.na is very effective as a **portal** to information, due to **multi-modality** and **flat ontology**. For data to feel **portable** however it needs to be retrievable on the widest possible range of devices, in as many formats as possible and be easily ported in or out of the system at will. This requirement is where many '[[tools for thought]]' fail, why [[plain/thesis/thesis-practise#^bd8f03|data format decisions]] are so important and where I believe Are.na [[plain/thesis/thesis-practise#^7b77d2|lets itself down]], as I'll discuss below. **Interoperability** with other tools is improving, and committed community members are building tools and extensions, but much work could've been avoided through use of existing file formats that would allow the data to be used in existing tools. Notably, many beloved '[[tools for thought]]' are simple interfaces over markdown files, or utilise web standards such as HTML, JSON or XML. As phrased by Rettburg  [[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation|(2005)]] , it is important that new methods 'coexist simultaneously with extant systems," ([[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation|pp. 2]]; [[Understanding Screenshot Collection and Sharing on Messaging Platforms A Privacy Perspective|Ingber, 2025]]).

At its extreme, extensive access to external memory can feel like [[ambient intelligence]]. This was generally considered a positive on Are.na, which I attribute to the fact the surrounding information you access is self-selected, on your own boards or from those you choose to follow. There was mixed sentiment on the **infinite** nature of this **void**-like space, with some **information overload** as well as frequent praise that there was **no noise** to distract users from their individual goals. Here the ethos of the platform limits the creep of attention-grabbing features and content. 

### brain prosthesis over brain replacement

^323b17
Are.na is commonly described as a 'second brain', an extension or replacement of the first. I want to highlight the difference between these metaphors to align with Smolicki's [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(2017)]] call for 'synergy versus substitution' with mnemotechnologies. [[Second brains are just as faulty as first brains (just differently so)]], and the task of technology is to augment particular functions. Many Are.na users referred to it more as **extended memory** than cognition itself, which aligns with the [[plain/thesis/thesis-context#^fdd06b|prior discussion]] of [[externalised memory]]. I determined the most accurate metaphors to be those referencing **brain interfaces**, as this reflects the **mnemotechnical** use extending beyond Are.na's particular instantiation. A slight twist on this was mention of **transparency**, as this both speaks to the development of a [[knowledge commons]] and to the immediacy of access discussed in other themes.

## Beyond Are.na

^0aed41

### [[cognitive capitalism|Capitalist Realism]]

^400355

The primary limitation of Are.na is that it functions as a company first. Despite the innovative imaginings, community-centred feature development, open-sourcing of code and commitment to ethical principles, Are.na is still fundamentally for-profit, locks features behind paywalls, and runs a closed dev team. It's not in my interest nor skillset to conduct a full investigation of Are.na's business practises. With stated plans to consider a co-operative structure in time, their commitment to their userbase is stronger than most. I consider my role here to be to explore the possibilities of tools not unlike Are.na without the constraints of capital - to remove the assumption of effective tools being measured by number of users and/or opportunities for revenue. Decentralised storage in at-home, in-community or distributed servers already goes some way to reduce costs of running central content provision. 

### Data model

^7b77d2

The major structural limitations of Are.na are its **centralised data store** and **non-standard data format**. All user data is stored centrally without any migration options (and limited export capability). The 'Are.na commons' is not a true [[digital commons]] as it is centrally managed and approved ([Are.na Commons](https://www.are.na/are-na-commons/channels), no date). Designating this space as the commons de-emphasises open channels originated by other accounts and 'orphans' those transferred, but does allow for disassociating from what you created. Whilst its data format is open, it is not widely adopted and therefore in practise Are.na is functionally not interoperable with other tools. These decisions are fundamentally incompatible with the ethos it has established, suggesting that the aligned community vision is more of an aesthetic or aspirational one than a technical reality. 

### Atomic fragments

^7c8fd2

Further to this, my analysis exposed limitations with the foundational structures of 'block', 'channel', and 'connection'. Are.na depends on a **flat ontology** where blocks have no hierarchy. This enables arbitrary connections between blocks and channels, but not within blocks or for comments or metadata. It also excludes usage patterns that benefit from hierarchy. Whilst this structure is fundamental to the reconfigurability of blocks, containing mixed kinds of data may require mixed structures. I witnessed circumvention of this lack where users spread text over multiple blocks or made unusual use of channels. My own experience of transferring notes from Obsidian to Logseq and back again exposed this (common) complaint. Self-designed hierarchies could be useful and play nicely with a default flat structure. This generally leads us to consider the question of [[what counts as an atomic fragment]]. Text within Are.na blocks isn't divisible and a larger passage of text composed by blocks isn't easily readable (through the standard interface - use of the API would mitigate this). Nevertheless, many Are.na users in my [[Are.na meta-analysis|meta-analysis]] made reference to blocks as variations of **mind atoms**, designating the fragments they stored as 'thoughts', 'ideas', 'concepts' and similar. As none of these are strictly defined (nor definable), their mediating structure should not assume any atomic form beyond its strictest technological limit of a single bit.

### decentralisation and data ownership as resistance

^a7b7ef
The past few decades have seen "a betrayal of the liberating possibilities of technology" (Liu, 2020, p.4) as economic forces have restructured the political and social landscape of the Internet. As phrased by Liu (2020, p.5) "The problem is not technology, per se: the problem is capitalism." The primary structural features of a more equitable internet are [[decentralisation]] and [[data ownership]].  Within "ideological infrastructure that both supports and facilitates feminist interventions within connective, networked elements" [[The Xenofeminist Manifesto|(Cuboniks, 2019)]] we can strengthen a platform like Are.na through data sovereignty, or, the rights of users to their own externalised selves. 

Another motivating goal is that of [[permacomputing]] - to maintain robust, future-proof technological systems with reduced environmental impact. Decentralised systems for data storage and backup are more robust to technical faults, changes in weather or climate, and political, economic or personnel impacts on a singular company's servers. (cite) Even in accessing Are.na for this thesis I was afforded an ironically fortuitous example of single-point failure when a Cloudflare fault took out Are.na along with many larger sites ([McMahon, 2025](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c629pny4gl7o)). 

Data ownership is a more widely contested issue, with companies claiming rights over data in order to run particular services or to profit from selling it to data brokers and advertisers. Critical Data Studies emphasises the reduction of harm to marginalised groups in use of their data, calling for more control over when we are required or coerced into giving certain data and more robust  consent mechanisms. Self-storage (or at least a diverse range of storage providers) for personal data with fine-grained access control (as well as compliance from end applications) is necessary to prevent unwanted harvesting or leakage of personal information. More assurance of privacy and the scope of audience for individual fragments can enable **intimate publics**, incubating the kinds of resistance that promote wider systemic change. 

## System Design
### very-brief intro to Solid and the semantic web

^8cedb2

In situating a solution to the task of connectivity with fine-grained privacy in the Semantic Web and Linked Data I was reminded of the Solid project [(solidproject.org)](https://solidproject.org/about) (Sambra et al., 2016). Whilst numerous [[Web 1.0]] standards are still present on the web, momentum behind Solid and ActivityPub seems to be consistent, with retained alignment to ethical foundations. I chose to work tentatively with specific implementations to demonstrate the systems I'm describing without asserting the quality of any specific toolset. I've decided to implement a system in ActivityPod (a framework for building apps that combine ActivityPub and Solid protocols) with embedded doekieli to handle basic markdown file editing within the Solid context.

### Data formats

^bd8f03

UPDATE WHEN I DECIDE
I'll be manually transferring a sample set of the notes stored here into HTML+RDFa or JSON-LD to demonstrate how a modern web frontend can pull from a Solid Pod as its data source. My [[data format decisions]] are based on a combination of my own experience, the analysis completed here, some technical literature, and compatibility with my preferences or habits in web development as expressed in my [[provotypes|provotypical]] [[what is this|documentation site]]. 

### Enabling Curation and Connectivity

^0318a5

A mnemotechnique that allows **reconfigurability** must allow fragments to be modular, arbitrarily arrangeable and have robust fine-grained privacy so data can be (primarily) stored [[all in one place]] for an individual. Data pertaining to a collective can be stored by collectives in a model of networked stores with this fine-grained privacy through Solid with ActivityPub (e.g. in [ActivityPods](https://activitypods.org)). A network of local commons respects the situatedness of data storage in [[the internet as physical infrastructure|physical servers]] whilst prioritising [[accessibility]] and [[connectivity]], in line with collectivist and xenofeminist desires [[The Xenofeminist Manifesto|(Cuboniks, 2019)]]. 

### Interfacing the [[public, private and personal]]

The **co-presence** of others, with **control** over private and public data I found to be of great importance to Are.na users. A major uniqueness of the platform is the primacy of this distinction, with both open and closed [[interoperable individual and collective views|individual or shared]] channels indicated prominently in the minimal interface. In (re-)designing a **tool** or **space** for reflexive curation (as Are.na users variously characterised it) this [[blurred public-private boundaries online|boundary between the private and the public]] holds critical potential for the 'lines of flight' previously discussed (where?). Single- and multi-authored views should exist in the same frame over the same content using Solid's fine-grained privacy features, so the single perspective can be responsibly collated into the collective whole. Insights on combining metadata in particular comes from [[Web 1.0]] literature on forming [[evolving taxonomies|'folksonomies' from 'personomies']], but Critical Data Studies' frameworks of [[situated knowledge|situated knowledges]] supports manual self-directed translation between personal semantics and community frameworks. The crucial difference here from AI-generated categorisation and alignment is in the individual as the arbiter of 'collapse' or 'equivalence' of their terms and someone else's. Fragments can be "at the same time personal and public" [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]] and so require consensual and self-initiated associations to prevent [[false equivalence]] of terms used differently by different individuals or groups that shouldn't necessarily co-mingle. Simultaneous presence of our intra- and inter-personal notes facilitate the shift from self-actualisation to self-transcendence, as discussed [[plain/thesis/thesis-context#^3efdf7|prior]].  Directly overlaying comparative views or annotations could allow for [[situated logics]] of individual meaning, negotiating interpretations "either set against the hegemonic forces or compliant with them" [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]]. Crucially, the boundaries of included views are self-determined and not algorithmically / monetarily influenced, omitting the defaults of dangerous misinformation and echo chambers. (find something to cite here).

SKETCH - comingling different uses of acronyms

### Multi-root and multi-view

Allowing [[pluriversality|pluriversal]] knowledges of equal import requires **multiple views** of the same content with no 'single source of truth'. This accounts for content 'syndicated' on multiple platforms, for contested authorship, for untraceability of digital images (where did i read this) and versioning. Multiple screenshots of the same site from different users could be 'collapsed' into a singular but multipliticous entity, an assemblage of all available perspectives of the 'original' post. On search engines and content stores such as Pinterest, image recognition is often used to uncover 'similar' images, but these features are of varying quality as are often a reactionary addition in response to masses of redundant data. Accepting the inherent multiplicity of digital content rather than arbitrarily restricting it is the plight of content pirates, digital archivists and machine learning advocates alike, but giving the poster agency over what it is subsumed into is rare. This agency could be forefronted with a prominent interface powered by a property similar to w3c's 'sameAs' (cite properly). [[what is this|Here]], I've been using a mixture of 'alias' and 'peer' to indicate not only arbitrary redirects and related topics but also this common case of concepts that are arguably identical, hold some particular nuance or are one term used in multiple contexts. This is also akin to Wikipedia's 'disambiguation'. 

(add more theory evidence to the above and below)
### [[semantic links|Semantic Links]]

This new 'sameAs' property would be only one of any number of arbitrary connections linking each fragment in a system based on semantic linking. Both the [[#^73d764|Pinterest analysis]], [[#^c78069|Are.na analysis]] and Are.na meta-analysis highlighted the need for meaningful associations between fragments and other web content. For both Pinterest pins and Are.na blocks the connectivity and therefore usefulness was limited by a single option for source link. Are.na users valued the **multi-directionality** of connections between content on the platform and its **graph-like traversal** but made diverse use of the 'connection' feature. Whilst this arbitrary connection fits fleeting expression or 'generally to-do with' relations, many connections would've benefitted from structured data associated with the link. To prioritise human readability whilst making these connections useable for structured traversal, semantic statements (e.g. 'fragment1 is-a documentType1' or 'fragment2 is-sequel-to fragment1') are the preferable format. Some blocks in my Are.na analysis showed the potential of associative linking, connecting to the equivalent entries in Wikipedia, WorldCat (library search) or Google Search results. 

### Assertion and metadata

This multi-root/multi-view paradigm must extend also to metadata. Tags are seen variously as content and metadata (Berendt and Hanser, 2007; [[Parallel Posts|Rose, 2025;]] [[tumblr (book)|Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021, pp.27]]),  and labelling under a personal semantic framework is essential for agential curation, as shown by work on [[evolving taxonomies|folksonomies]] that found individual's tags 'not settling on common decentralized meanings' (Berendt and Hanser, 2007) and that people primarily tag for themselves first ([[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation|Rettburg, 2005]]; [[Parallel Posts|Rose, 2025]]).  

Other forms of metadata are just as contestable as the fragment content itself, such as the title of a place as understood by indigenous groups or international agreement. No statement is universal and all statements are inherently authored. To allow statements to simply refer to or to instead assert confidence in a fragment, not only the content itself must allow provenance but the upload/modification/inclusion of the fragment itself. In selecting a kind of semantic data format to use this has major impact - I cannot use just a standard semantic triple but must use either **named graphs** or semantic **quads**, two methods to attach **context** to the statement itself. I found most useful the comparison of Massari et al. (2025) as historical provenance is the most extreme (or formal) use case of my own requirement in resistive fragment assemblages. 

For usability and **multi-purpose** usage patterns, both minimal and maximal metadata must be acceptable. In my analyses, residue of information clung to screenshots from prior collection and reposting. There are [[contextualised over decontextualised fragments|cases for]] this data being retained for extra [[putting content in context|context]], [[provenance]] or [[knowledge lineage]] as well as deautomating the selection of relevant parts, but also [[decontextualised over contextualised fragments|for extracting content]] for [[readability]], [[accessibility]] or [[privacy, security and surveillance|privacy]].


### contextualisation/decontextualisation and sharing annotations 
^72fb09

- where quotes are pulled from longer sources, even where cited in the 'source' or description, they're **not clearly indicated as quotes** and mix in with user-authored commentary. This can be both beneficial or detrimental, affirming again that [[contextualised and decontextualised fragments are both useful]]. 
- due to progressive rollout of features there are many link sources that now have dedicated embeds that haven't been updated, as well as a lot of **lint** in images that appear transferred from other sites or old collections, or added by extensions capturing as much metadata as possible. 
- others' [[annotations and marginalia]] can be useful
