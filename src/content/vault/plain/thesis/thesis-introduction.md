## Abstract

Anti-capitalist work in [[liberating the internet|liberating]] [[the everyday|everyday]] information practise from the goals of [[big tech|monopolising tech companies]] is spread thin across various industry concerns and [[interdisciplinarity|disciplinary hegemonies]]. By centering collectivist ideals I appeal to the digital commons and decentralised web to enable particular practises of hyperconnected personal curation that have potential for collectivist resistance. Through analysis of public assemblages of fragmented experience on existing web platforms ([[Pinterest analysis details|Pinterest]] and [[plain/meta-thesis/Are.na analysis|Are.na]]) I'll discuss the benefits that [[decentralised web|decentralised]] models and the [[semantic web]] could have on extra-institutional knowledge-work. This thesis is also a meta-work of [[self-exemplification]]. As a living [[provotypes|provotype]], this thesis is presented within a personal website indexing [[externalised memory|cues]] of my own [[self-transcendence]] through collectivist pedagogy and experimental tech. 

## Important Definitions
- **[[mnemotechniques and mnemotechnologies]]**: tools, methods, platforms and structures for storing and retrieving information, loosely separated by their reliance on a singular medium or 'attentive mode' ([[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]]; Stiegler, 2010) [[mnemotechniques and mnemotechnologies|(1)]] [[plain/thesis/thesis-context#Mnemotechnology under capitalist realism|(2)]] 
- **[[para-archival practise|para-archival]]**: deployment of capitalist tech for archival practises that "do not explicitly counteract, but evolve alongside or parallel to the proprietary power" [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]] -  "a second level interwoven into the first (de Certeau, 1984, p.31, cited by [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017, pp.20]])
- **[[collectivism|collectivist/collectivism]]**: used here as a deliberately general term, referring to leftist politics that emphasise communal care and ownership; not necessarily in neglect of the individual. I intend particularly to encompass anti-capitalist, anti-fascist, intersectional feminist, decolonialist and environmental movements. The closest specific political connotation I'm making is with **[[communalism]]** and **anarcho-communism** in the tradition of [Bookchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin) and [Kropotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin).
- **[[semantic web]]**: originally coined by [Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) to describe a web of connected data that is machine-readable. In modern developments and in my usage, it should also be maximally human-readable. 
- **[[semantic links]]**: a connection between two entities with meaning attached - a labelled relation such as 'X is the parent of Y' rather than simply 'X is related to Y'. Often used in in the context of the semantic web to refer to these *semantic triples* or *statements* described by a language such as RDF
- **[[RDF]] (Resource Description Framework)**: a language for structured description of arbitrary entities
- **[[Solid (RDF)|Solid]]**: a software ecosystem implementing decentralised web/semantic web concepts

## Structure of this thesis

First I'll discuss how fragments of information (as shared online) can be instrumental and affective, through discussion of the multi-modal blogging platform [[tumblr|Tumblr]]. I'll show how the assemblage, dissemination and recombination of fragments leaves room for reflexive curatorial work that promotes [[self-actualisation]] and [[self-transcendence]]. I'll go on to discuss external memory and the determination of mnemotechniques vs mnemotechnologies through [[active decision-making for regaining agency under controlling structures|active use of agency]], singular perspective and intersubjectivity. 

Later, I'll explore some pertinent findings from my analysis of resistive assemblages on [[Pinterest]] and [[Are.na]]. I'll discuss my analysis of Are.na users' view of the platform. Through insights from literature and further analyses I'll describe some major infrastructural elements necessary for enabling intersubjectivity, connectivity and reflexive curation of digital fragments.

Lastly, I'll discuss the implementation of such structures in [[Solid (RDF)|Solid]]. I've proposed data formats, tools and components that could combine to afford benefits of the decentralised and semantic web to an Are.na-like platform. I've proposed further work to complete this realisation and to expand this intersection of fields further.
