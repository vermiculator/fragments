## Research Direction

The most difficult thing about this thesis is that it is inherently non-linear, and I'm trying to do it justice in a linear format. I didn't want it to entirely rely on its own infrastructure to parse and so I settled on a somewhat traditional form with further expansions given in its full realisation in the context of the website. I'm aware that my research question itself is wide ranging and its proper extrapolation needs wider exploration of options for decentralised web technologies. My intent was not just to evidence the need for these kinds of technologies, which is well-documented in the general, but to evidence it in the specific. I aim to bridge the formal and the unstructured by applying the very-technical to emergent structures of knowledge online. 

An issue I see with my work is in the uncritical acceptance of connectivity as desirable. I could go much further to show where the 'right to be forgotten' should exclude authors from [[knowledge lineage]] or how anonymity or multiple identities should be preserved in order to protect the vulnerable. Favouring the 'information' over the sociability of sharing it may preclude certain kinds of knowledge (e.g. oral transmission that is inherently sociable) and encourage a "culture of connectivity instead of connection" [[tumblr (book)#^84fca4|(Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021, pp. 12)]]. My insistence on multiple views, fine-grained privacy and relational knowledges only partially address this. I could go further to highlight the value of experiential knowledges and interfacing with physical stores of data. I could also go much further to discuss what the decentralised web lacks, and what affects its adoption. In passing I blame the '[[nerdwall]]' [(@rosano, 2025)](https://mastodon.online/@rosano/114006483730508947) of technical infrastructure, poor usability and accessibility and lack of funding for developers (due to [[it was Agatha all along|capitalism]]). There's more potential for discussion of my own para-archival practises, as well as wider exploration of other practises that could be considered para-tactical or para-archival. 

## Platform analysis

I'd liked to have carried out more full case studies of individuals using Pinterest and/or Are.na, as their insights and motivations would've been valuable. I didn't necessarily establish that either of these assemblage practises resulted in significant action offline, or track the impact of them on the wider cultures of the internet. I may have fallen into the same trap described by Smolicki [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(2017, pp.43)]], where social media platforms are framed as the only dominant forces in personal archiving. I'd propose browser bookmarks, 'recent files' and screenshots as significant forms of personal archiving less prone to fluctuations, and could explore other counter-hegemonic forces such as the fediverse.

A minor constraint I faced in the analysis of these sites is in the lack of literature on Are.na beyond their self-published articles and interviews with founding members. I pulled heavily from literature on Pinterest and on social media in general or early web social bookmarking. It also proved logistically difficult to analyse both Pinterest and Are.na with the resources available due to the wide scope of 'resistance'. I opted for a loose qualitative analysis with selective sampling so I could exemplify themes I most wanted to address rather than evidence quantitative prevalence of particular patterns without having time to discuss their implications. I made many minor choices (e.g. omitting certain metadata) that will have skewed the framing of the data - for example, not including timestamps, which would've highlighted changes in usage over time (and through platform changes). In further iteration I would also analyse image assemblages on Pinterest made with the newer 'collage' feature, as linking image components back to source is of interest to wider horizons of this project, such as in the use of ImageSnippets' Linked Data (imagesnippets.com).

Are.na as a site of inquiry has much more room for analysis, on specifics of the community culture and infrastructure. I believe a social network analysis or discourse analysis would be particularly insightful. In methodologies, I believe Are.na could also be a good site for elicitating responses from those not reached by traditional surveying or interviewing, as the private channels can serve as a two-way asynchronous communicative space - I personally would be considerably more comfortable communicating with this mechanism in place. I'd be interested in studying Are.na also as an organisation, as one of a few '[[tools for thought]]' built around an engaged user-public-forum. 


## Method and Practise

In this format I found I could more freely explore a wide range of avenues without necessarily having to include it in the main body of the thesis. This inevitably caused split focus and difficulty narrowing it back down to the research question  at hand. However, I consider this inherent to the research process and the resulting peripheral notes of great value in exploring the full potential of the research topics - I've uncovered a lot of 'threads' open to exploring, and by publishing these online alongside my thesis both I and other researchers may take advantage of the extra connections I've established. 

My findings expand on work on on Pinterest, social bookmarking and internet platform usage. My unexpected findings were mostly in the mismatch of user conceptualisations of Are.na and its function. I also found my methodology difficult to pin down due to wide meta-interest in the mechanisms of academia and experimental forms. My most valuable contribution to method is in the explicit promotion of [[whim as direction]], as my [[autism]] and [[brain fog]] have necessitated following only the paths of study that repeatedly and consistently interest me. In following each [[rabbit-hole]] I've solidified a huge breadth of research interests that may wrestle for priority but encourage a holistic view of my subjects. By employing an atypical format I've allowed myself to [[lean into what inspires you|lean into what inspires me]], tentatively explore [[experimental publishing as collective struggle]], and  retain loose threads. The content (and knowledge) I've produced in this enquiry is inherently and deliberately messy, as part of my argument is for the value of messy, naturalistic, qualitative data that is inherently tied to its authorship and context. 

## Further Work

There are several [[plain/meta-thesis/directions|directions]] in which I'd like to take this work. Most practically, to develop and [[possibly later|iterate on the tool]] I've proposed with the technologies I've discussed. I intend to follow several connected threads in the near future and continue on the foundation I've laid here.

primarily
- more on annotations and highlights
- more on refinding, context, - [[thick screenshots]] and screenshotting practise.
