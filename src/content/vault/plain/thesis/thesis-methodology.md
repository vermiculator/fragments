## Framings

I'm working necessarily trans-disciplinary, or even anti-disciplinary, as my own ([[autism|autistic]]) practise has never benefitted from the arbitrary way that disciplines  'chop up the world of thought' (Davis, 1998). I consider disciplines as live assemblages in a constant state of flux. Through my research I've come to understand disciplines, knowledge and experience as a kind of [[affective category theory]], with personal and collective value at both the intersection and in diverging modes of understanding.

I'm working from a basis of [[collectivism]] as previously defined with particular principles aligned with [[xenofeminism]] and [[Critical Data Studies|Critical Data Studies (CDS)]]. This work is intended as the basis for wider work in Science and Technology Studies, with concepts from the humanities applied to systems design and software development. Much of the literature I found useful was from digital humanities, library or archival studies. The technical portion of my practise stems from modern web development as informed by and returning to work with the [[semantic web|Semantic Web]] and Linked Data. 

## Methods 

For my enquiry to form the basis of a software intervention I aimed for cohesive findings on usage and purpose of a tool for recording/curating/connecting fragments. I chose to analyse resistive assemblages found on Pinterest and Are.na to compare and contrast the use of these platforms. Much of the literature on Pinterest covers business applications and very little literature exists on Are.na.

I first performed an informal thematic [[Pinterest analysis details|analysis on Pinterest boards]], loosely selected for themes casually observed, as modelled by Moger [[Journaling into the void - TikTok's eudaimonic 'web-weaving' and its digital practises|(2024)]]. I separated text and image in the manner of  ==X by X==. Precise content messaging wasn't important to this so much as the relative frequency of expected formats and finding emergent themes. I selected the more valuable emergent themes to discuss, as combined with insights from literature. I focused on how the boards feature:
	a) future-building or inspiration
	b) actionable and non-actionable tasks
	c) mixed content types and multi-modal objects
	d) connectivity, provenance and further resources
I ended up with 32 boards that would be suitable for analysis, 7 of which fit maximal criteria for selection. For the themes I most wanted to discuss I created mock-ups in wireframing web-app [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/product/) (chosen for its minimal aesthetic), echoing the representative style chosen by Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin [[tumblr (book)|(2021)]].

I then followed a similar procedure with Are.na, this time working from the codes I'd established for Pinterest and altering, extending or replacing them as I saw fit for use with Are.na. I asked here how do boards of the same variety/under similar topics as on Pinterest a) compare b) contrast c) extend themes established on Pinterest? 

Finally, I performed a more rigorous thematic analysis on Are.na blocks collected from the open-publication channel ['How do you describe Are.na at a party?'](https://www.are.na/charles-broskoski/how-do-you-describe-are-na-at-a-party). I chose this channel for its many concise characterisations of the platform by a wide range of user-authors, but also its prominence on entry to the site as a new user. The subtext of the titular question appears to be 'what is **good** about Are.na?', 'what is **unique** about Are.na?', 'what **characterises** Are.na?', and 'how do you **use** it?'. I believe the responses here say a lot about both the current and idealised usage, often with [[techno-auto-archaeology|techno-auto-archaeological]] accounts or metaphors of desired sociability. I carried out mixture of inductive and deductive coding iteratively by descriptive (in vivo) coding followed by interpretative coding. I chose to directly embed Are.na blocks (where users consented) to both facilitate hyperconnectivity, to acknowledge authorship and for "direct participation without representation or mediation" (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987: 471, cited by [[Four Data Discourses and Assemblage Forms A Methodological Framework|Fussell, 2022]]).

## Justification of Format

Whilst this work can be read as a standard thesis, its full extent is realised through an experimental web interface connected to a wider body of work. It was important to me to offer at least an element of liveness, evolving form and self-exemplification as a primary success factor for this work is in extoling the value of assembled fragments and subversive, open academic practise. It makes sense to me to present a non-linear assemblage to discuss non-linear assemblage. This linear prose is a gateway. 

This format is connective, it exists beyond the conventions of knowledge-making under an institution and shows a route to [[experimental publishing as collective struggle]]. This site exists as [[provotypes|provotype]], as in Smolicki's [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(2017)]] [[para-archival practise|para-archives]], that can "provok\[e] reflection on alternate modes of personal archives and post-digital memory practices,". It also provides a 

On a personal level, I understand that research is personal, the personal is political, and research is political; the elucidation of this work is inextricably tangled with the narrative of my professional journey and socio-political education, with how systematic factors have denied me my skills and my voice and my worth. It is crucial for me to be able to position minds [[neurodiversity|like my own]] (regardless of opportunities for work and study) as the "new profession of trailblazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record,"[[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation|(Rettburg, 2005)]] as envisioned by Bush (of *Memex* fame). This work *has* to be too personal and all-encompassing and far too long, as its the first chance I've had to leave roots from which more can grow. 

### [[index of potential]]

An important insight from taking notes in [[build this|this format]] is that [[redlinks are important|blank pages in an index are still useful]]. Whilst some fragments of text here function as pages of notes, the vast majority could be reconfigured into 'tags', or are more generally **indices** for topics of interest. Using an arbitrary fragment as any description or categorisation works both here in my simple collection of markdown files or in a [[semantic web|semantic data]] setup, and allows me easily identifiable starting points to 'tend to' my assemblage **as ritual**, a common pattern of self-actualisation through Are.na. Ted Nelson ([Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu)) described [[redlinks are important|this potential]] of the [red link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Red_link) as '[lacuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacuna)' or gap in which ideas can grow ([[Ted Nelson on hypertext|Ted Nelson demonstrates Xanadu Space, 2008]]; [[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation|Rettburg, 2005]]). Whilst individual pages look sparse, the connections between them are thick with meaning.
