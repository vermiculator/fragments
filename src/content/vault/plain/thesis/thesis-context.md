## Background

### Instrumental fragments

^b79ff2

[[Critical Data Studies|Critical Data Studies (CDS)]] allows us to conceptualise data 'as resistance' and 'as latent knowledge' [[Four Data Discourses and Assemblage Forms A Methodological Framework|(Fussell, 2022)]]. This knowledge may be instrumentalised in the appropriate context towards socio-political change - 'as resistance' [[Four Data Discourses and Assemblage Forms A Methodological Framework|(Fussell, 2022)]]. The experiential knowledge (cite) shared online by multiply marginalised people has such resistive potential due to its "eudaimonic (i.e., emotionally poignant, existential, or vulnerable)" quality [[Journaling into the void - TikTok's eudaimonic 'web-weaving' and its digital practises|(Moger, 2024, pp. iv)]]. On the one hand, this is expressed in shared joy, success stories and solidarity. On the other, this resistance appears as 'affective dissonance' (Hemmings, 2012), where anger and grief resonates in the 'onto-epistemological gap' [[library/Lubunya Assemblages - Queer Networked Resistances in Turkey|(Kilic, 2024)]] between embodied and prescripted lives. This affect expressed through social platforms and digital media circulated online directly 'spurs action' to bridge the gap (Hemmings, 2012). Kilic [[library/Lubunya Assemblages - Queer Networked Resistances in Turkey|(2024)]], in their discussion of "queer counter-archival practices" in Turkey, describes how this circulation of affect allows "an everyday or individualised action \[to] eventually become transformative,". They cite the Lubunca term "gullüm alıkmak" (or making gullüm) to describe the 'collective act of joy or humour as resistance'  that can incite restorative change when faced with this dissonance (or 'madilik') (Ozban, 2022, p. 134, as cited by [[library/Lubunya Assemblages - Queer Networked Resistances in Turkey|Kilic, 2024]]).

Sharing affective experiential fragments is common on the social blogging platform Tumblr, which can be seen as an '[[Blurred Public-Private Boundaries and Ethical Practices Through a Case Study on Instagram#^452c9f|intimate public]]' (Berlant, 2008, p. viii) of the personal on semi-public display, as is the characterisation of Instagram given in the ethical discussion by Ravn, Barnwell and Neves ([[Blurred Public-Private Boundaries and Ethical Practices Through a Case Study on Instagram#^5fd93a|2021]]). Users of such platforms assume a '[[Blurred Public-Private Boundaries and Ethical Practices Through a Case Study on Instagram#^c5d489|common feeling]]' in their '[[Blurred Public-Private Boundaries and Ethical Practices Through a Case Study on Instagram#^98f1d7|imagined audiences]]' ([[Blurred Public-Private Boundaries and Ethical Practices Through a Case Study on Instagram|Ravn, Barnwell and Neves, 2021]]) that allows their perspective to resonate with others of similar experience. Building on Foucault's (1988) work, Rose defines the Tumblr blog as a "curatorial technolog\[y] of the self", on the same historical trajectory of commonplace books and sentiment albums. [[Parallel Posts#^eb4287|(Rose, 2023; 2025)]]. 
### Resistive counterpublics online

^05cc22

As a collective, Tumblr has a (noted) focus on fandom, feminism, queer experience, NSFW topics, social justice and mental health (Tiidenberg, Henry and Abidin, 2021, pp. 9) that (defines) its "[[Parallel Posts#^8263e6|broadly counterpublic gathering]]" (Rose, 2025). Users describe it as "communal, consciousness-raising, therapeutic and educational" [[tumblr (book)#^558c77|(Tiidenberg, Henry and Abidin, 2021, pp. 9)]], a culture Rose attributes to the [[Parallel Posts#^d56dd4|knowledge-building]] associated with "[[Parallel Posts|bookishness]]" but also to the structurally subversive [[Parallel Posts#^f04d44|feed-first infrastructure, allowance for anonymity and disconnection from commercial income]] ([[Parallel Posts|Rose, 2023; 2025]]). Its "[[Parallel Posts#^f5c0fe|persevering influence]]" ([[Parallel Posts#^f5c0fe|Rose, 2023; 2025; Tiffany 2023; Stein 2017]]) on wider cultures, as the origin of shifting discourse and widely-circulated screenshots [[Parallel Posts#^394e35|(Rose, 2025 pp.175)]], earns it the characterisation of "[[Parallel Posts#^a882b5|simultaneously countercultural, subcultural, and trendsetting]]" (Rose, 2025). 

This combination of resistive structural potential and wide cultural influence situates the incubation of affective counter-publics online as liberatory practise. Rather than Tumblr, I've chosen to focus my initial enquiry on Pinterest, as it hosts similar content in its undercurrent despite being both culturally and structurally more steeped in capitalist modes of production ([[library/Public Curation and Private Collection The Production of Knowledge on Pinterest.Com|Lui, 2015]]). Examining Pinterest boards on counter-hegemonic topics allows us to isolate the limitations of mainstream information infrastructure and specify where multi-threaded, '[[Parallel Posts#^be56ce|multi-modal]]' and '[[Parallel Posts#^6bb938|hyperconnected]]' ([[Parallel Posts|Rose, 2025]]) or 'rhizomatic' (Tekobbe, 2013) systems would add to the affective and instrumental capacity.

On Tumblr, extensive informational resources are progressively developed through chains of 'reblogs'. Experiential knowledge and external quotations or screencaps are assembled into singular affective experiences through 'web-weaving' (a.k.a. parallel posts or # parallels), a cross-platform practise of "[[Parallel Posts#^9666b6|transformative transtextuality]]" originated by Tumblr users ([[Parallel Posts|Rose, 2023; 2025]]; [[Journaling into the void - TikTok's eudaimonic 'web-weaving' and its digital practises#^3af4e0|Moger, 2024]]). Both a web-weaving post, a blog of posts, or a user's entire feed can be considered an assemblage of [[multi-modal]] fragments (Rose, 2025). The emergent value of these kinds of curatorial labour is in instrumental use of resource threads, in the affective capacity of web-weaves, and in the resistive potential of their adjacency on a blog or feed. 

Pinterest is both used instrumentally and "enables the invaluable creation of information in addressing people’s affective demands," ([[Creating by Me, and for Me Investigating the Use of Information Creation in Everyday Life|Lee, Ocepek and Makri, 2021]]). Literature on digital platform infrastructure doesn't account for the doubled value of this combination of instrumental and affective usage. Personal archive studies focus on identity construction or memory-making whilst usability focuses on interfaces and productivity aligned towards [[capitalist efficiency]]. My discussion of personal, temporary, and ad-hoc knowledges is supported more widely by science and technology studies,  digital humanities, archival sciences and the digital commons, with a firm root in collectivism.

## Personal archives
### Curating for ourselves and others

^e44040

Marketed as a site of 'inspiration', for improving 'life and work' ("About," [2013](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/347315572/#page-13-0) ), Pinterest is a contested space of [[anti~consumerism|commercialisation]] caught in the neo-liberal trap of individualism. Its infrastructure encourages you to save with intent to purchase rather than share in a collective dream [[Public Curation and Private Collection The Production of Knowledge on Pinterest.Com|(Lui, 2015)]]. Despite many personal boards being technically public, the mass of other content affords a kind of '[[privacy in public on Pinterest|privacy in public]]'. Lui ([[library/Public Curation and Private Collection The Production of Knowledge on Pinterest.Com|2015]]) describes this blurring of boundaries as "the distinction between curation and collection", as "it is understood" that personal collections are publicly available, but X refutes this, claiming that Pinterest users often don't know their profiles are public.

According to X, collecting for ourselves and collecting for others is not always a clear intentional shift. The practise of [[commoning]] in collectivist politics actively [[the commons blurs the boundaries of altruistic and selfish intent|dismantles this boundary]], as whether the intent was first for yourself or first for the collective, both you and the collective will benefit. For metadata, research from [[Web 1.0]] explores tagging practises as both selfish and altruistic (Hammond et al., 2005). Tumblr's tags too are described as both personal and metacommunicative [[tumblr (book)|(Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021)]]. For digital content specifically, Ingber [[Understanding Screenshot Collection and Sharing on Messaging Platforms A Privacy Perspective|(2025)]] stresses the distinction between collection for yourself and for others in capturing screenshots of personal messages due to 'privacy turbulence', a concept elaborated by Smolicki ([[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|2017]]), whose "camera, always pointing outwards, covered other people" - as our intimate lives involve the intimate lives of others, our [[privacy is contextual|privacy]] is inherently contested space.

Instead of intended audience, I distinguish [[curation]] from collection by its [[recombination|recombinatory]] nature. In the juxtaposition of elements we're offered room to reflect and rearrange (Smolicki, 2017, [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^d45340|pp. 26]], [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^dc3c8b|pp. 60]]), and so the value of an assemblage is in the unique, intentional combination of fragments according to differing frameworks, contexts or priorities. Even in a static curated exhibit, "the visitor is encouraged to actively \[...] build their own connections", and "need not follow the same path as the curator, nor reach the same conclusion" [[Curation, Curation, Curation|(Wolff and Mulholland, 2013)]]. To learn from what you're consuming, "content curation cannot be merely about collecting, but must include the interpretation and organisation" [[Curation, Curation, Curation|(Wolff and Mulholland, 2013)]]. Nomadic data discourse in [[Critical Data Studies|CDS]]  describes how the [[recombined fragments|recombination of data fragments]] has unlimited potential for qualitative transformation, unlike statist treatments of quantitative data. Here, fragments can 'enter into new combinations without arbitrary limit or so-called “natural” or “hierarchical” uses and meanings’ (Nail, 2017: 32-33, cited in [[Four Data Discourses and Assemblage Forms A Methodological Framework|Fussell, 2022]]).

### Intersubjectivity

^3efdf7

As individuals, our situated [[power in the single perspective|singular perspective]] is the interface to the collective. The point at which our own frameworks [[affective category theory|diverge]] from another's can then be of "powerful personal significance." [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.146)]]. Subjective, internal perspectives are in many cultures the determinant of a 'self'. I prefer to define the 'self' as a "multidimensional construct containing both intra- and interpersonal beings" (Maurer et al., 2023, cited in Moger, 2024). 

On Tumblr, both "personal and collective experience are intertwined" ([[library/Parallel Posts|Rose, 2025]], pp. 36; [[tumblr (book)|Tiidenberg, Hendry, and Abidin, 2021]]), and Pinterest boards are formed on personal semantics that are influenced by but distinct from other users (Tekobbe, 2013). Smolicki [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(2017)]] describes personal, intentional, curational practises as 'para-archival' in that they "foreground the accounts of the everyday that are formed singularly and silently from within" rather than directly counter-to hegemonic strategy ([[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]], pp.137).

These frameworks imply an interdependent selfhood inherently connected to context and to other people ([[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]], pp. 219). Construction of selfhood can then be understood as an inherently communal process that can be mediated through **affective technologies** that "combat alienation from oneself and others." [[Journaling into the void - TikTok's eudaimonic 'web-weaving' and its digital practises|(Moger, 2024)]]. Deleuze (1991) FIND THIS describes this as a 'folding' or 'internalizing' of outside forces resulting in **affective intersubjectivity**. 

Collectivism in its furthest extension therefore necessitates [[pluriversality]], where the subjective meets the intersubjective at many points, with no single objective truth. Para-archives, as articulated by Smolicki, acknowledge 'the heterogeneity and plurality of micro-perspectives, forms of alterity that might be incompatible with the mainstream, strategic, and regulatory." [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.137)]]. Para-archival therefore constitutes [[collectivism|resistance to individualism]] and universalism through "subjectivity shared with others" [[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation#^fbf6b4|(Rettburg, 2005)]]. In my own experience I relate this concept to [[holotropism]]: articulated by Hendl H Mirra [[Holotropism A Multi-Dimensional, Spacious, Edgeless Terrain|(2023)]] as a combination of [[monotropism|monotropic theory]] and [[deep ecology]] through the lived experience of specifically autistic 'coherence', 'wholeness' and 'effortless integration' with all interconnected things [[Holotropism A Multi-Dimensional, Spacious, Edgeless Terrain|(Hendl H Mirra, 2023)]]. 

 In combining individuals into wholes, [[from web 1.0 to web 2.0|the current era of innovation period]] largely focuses on the aggregate, increasingly in the form of large language models (LLMs). I'd argue that in forming "linguistically generated intersubjectivity" (Habermas, cited by [[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation|Rettburg, 2005]]), individuals can only be represented if combined with their active consent and participation, in order to represent "alternative, non-centric conceptual zones, fluid individual practices and imaginations" [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.47)]] without subsuming these peripheries into a new centre. This would constitute Smolicki's '*responsible* construction of subjecthood'  ([[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|2017]], pp. 74, emphasis added). 

### External Memory

^fdd06b

Both individual and collective memories are entangled with the environments of storing and retrieving them. Smolicki (2017), citing Stiegler's “originary prostheticity” (1998, p.153), claims that [[internal and external memory|external memory cues]] or [[mnemonic traces]] are 'inseparable' from internal structures [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^feaa4c|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.53-54)]] as memory inherently functions through 'external' augmentation. Disabled people often live functionally as [[cyborgs]], with blurred boundaries between the internal and external, or between body and prosthesis. Rejecting the notion of the 'natural' as the [[The Xenofeminist Manifesto#^c0acc9|sacred]] ([[The Xenofeminist Manifesto|Cuboniks, 2019]]), we can place no consistently meaningful boundary between the body as a tool and external apparatus. These external traces, when produced by marginalised or isolated individuals, can construct resistive [[counter-publics]] as communities amass through [[trans-individuation]] [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp.54)]].

Both Moger [[Journaling into the void - TikTok's eudaimonic 'web-weaving' and its digital practises|(2024)]] and Smolicki [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^114f92|(2017)]] discuss external archives in terms of [[self-transcendence]], at the (later added) peak of Maslow's hierarchy of needs (1969). I propose that general purpose internet archives can work on all levels of this model through the combination of fragments for both "practical and conceptual needs" [[Creating by Me, and for Me Investigating the Use of Information Creation in Everyday Life#^f7e084|(Lee, Ocepek and Makri, 2021)]] and the "transpersonal welfare of the collective".  

### Capitalist realism 

^784187
If material [[mnemonic traces]] can constitute the self [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017, pp. 219)]], ownership and privacy of this self is important. Through the [[forced progressivism|forced technological progressivism]] of [[Web 2.0]], individual archival practises have been [[from mnemotechnique to mnemotechnology|transformed]], 'contaminated and instrumentalized by economic, commercial, and political agendas ([[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^f99ee5|Smolicki, 2017]], pp. 111) in an era of widespread [[platformisation]] and [[cognitive capitalism|capitalist realism]] (Fisher, 2009). These "easily monitorable [[mnemotechniques and mnemotechnologies|mnemotechnological]] enclosures" ([[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^f99ee5|Smolicki, 2017]], pp. 62) are able to dominate attention, meaning-making and privacy as they "make people adapt, somewhat passively, to their internal rules" ([[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]], pp. 56-57). 

If we choose instead to engage with [[mnemotechniques and mnemotechnologies|mnemotechniques]] as "**intentional** practices of externalizing memory and knowledge" ([[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]], emphasis added) we can [[active decision-making for regaining agency under controlling structures|regain or retain agency]] within cultures of automated data capture. Smolicki [[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^1ce7f6|(2017)]] describes this as a shift from passive to active forms of remembering, or from '[[capture|capturing]]' to '[[recording]]'.

### Emergent everyday practise

^3b5e49

The realm of [[the everyday]] is one in which marginalised people (multiply-marginalised and [[optimising the everyday as a disabled person|disabled people]] in particular) have to constantly innovate and experiment, due to environments, systems and objects constructed for a [[the pseudo-universal human|pseudo-universal]] brain and body. Iterative creative practises can be a matter of survival, in bending tools and rules to fit you, and extra-institutional study is common. I approach the study of [[everyday information practise]] in line with cultural studies of the endotic as applied to digital media. Smolicki ([[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|2017]]) looks to "blur the boundary between the amateur and professional" [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^191b79|(2017, p23)]] in attending to creative information practise as research thinking. 

Through my personal use of internet platforms I've engaged in information practises **instrumentally**, both **as and for** self-emancipation, in the study of collective [[liberation]]. I will later explore how others engage in similar para-archival practises in the everyday use of these platforms. I will also attend to [[para-archival practise|para-archival]] as [[slow tactics|para-tactics]]: an extension beyond the dichotomy of strategy vs tactics where "resistance seem\[s] to emerge slowly, stubbornly, and persistently, over longer periods of time" ([[Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|Smolicki, 2017]], pp. 117, 145).
