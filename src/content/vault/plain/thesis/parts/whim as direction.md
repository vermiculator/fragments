an inherently neurodivergent practise

 I feel like a lot of the trouble I'm having with defining methodologies is that I don't think general methods are particularly suited to the kind of holistic, pluralistic research I'm trying to do... I need to be able to follow each [[rabbit-hole]] and develop what comes out of it - I'm having trouble explaining why all my disparate methods and areas of interest all coalesce in one overall goal as I (and surely many many others) don't/can't adhere strictly to set schedule and doing so makes for a worse time and worse research. My best work always comes from following whim, 'leaning into what's easy'[[lost source|->]] but [[toxic productivity]] and [[professionalism|toxic professionalism]] as well as [[low trust harms early careers]] make it very difficult to prove you do better when left to stew in something for a while. I'm actively embracing the looseness of my practise here to show rigorous work can converge from numerous places, especially if it is driven by values. My brain is a labyrinth but it all connects back up in the middle. 

also in communicative style - the language here will flow from complex to simple as a matter of necessity, ability and expression. My natural voice prioritises accuracy and precision as situation dictates, dependant on focus on emotional transfer, informing others, effective collaboration, etc.
