## emergent common codes lacking depth
- for creatives, artists, researchers - defining audience by a limited set of occupations as marketed
- surface level interface descriptors and general praise
- party - referencing the question context literally (whimsical tone may be of note but not relevant here)
- use as a tool, specifically often as a research tool, or for productivity
- reference to objects, posts, blocks, content, information - general / marketing terms
- digital / on the internet / virtual - self-explanatory
- now / next / modern / 21st century - comparison to older media, remediation
- 'intellectual', smart ('nerd' and 'pretentious' are the more interesting forms of this, see above)
- referring to generally a place, a space, a site, a platform or another spatial metaphor - common to web experiences
