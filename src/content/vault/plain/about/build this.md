I started this in the common pattern of Markdown notes  + static site generator, of which there are many combinations.

This site in its current form is:
- written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- structured by [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- bootstrapped by [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/)
	- additional plugins:
		- [starlight-site-graph](https://github.com/Fevol/starlight-site-graph)
		- [starlight-obsidian](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-obsidian)
- styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
	- additional components:
		- [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) UI components
- built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

My workflow uses:
- [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) for highlighting and annotating texts
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for writing and knowledge management
	- essential plugins:
		- [Readwise integration](https://github.com/readwiseio/obsidian-readwise)
		- [Text Extractor](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-text-extractor)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development and deployment
