title: 'why i write lowercase'
---
- informality, readability
- texting habits
- coding habits
- i use capitals for Emphasis
- rejection of the Proper, rejection of professionalism
- context - i'm autistic, my brain prefers it, and i've learnt the importance of respecting these kinds of quirks
- an 'i' in particular seems less assertive and more speculatory in lowercase - i as in my current flow of thoughts, not I as in A Fixed Entity
- mostly - i usually type one-handed, i'm quicker and less strained this way - chronic pain and bodily positioning
