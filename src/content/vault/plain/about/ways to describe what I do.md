title: 'ways to describe what i do'
---

- I study the tensions and blurred boundaries between private, public, personal and social information practises
- its like philosophy ethics and socio-politics as they concern technologies
- The handling of uncertainties, irrationalities and unknowables as valuable data under flexible frameworks
- human-computer interaction with as much agency on the human side as possible
- queer-anarchistic approach to tech development
- human-centred design for technologies
- wanting to advise on tech policy
- digital humanities, taxonomies, linked data
