- "Illinois was the [first state to pass similar protections](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/tech/kid-influencer-law/index.html) for child influencers in 2023\. Since then, bills have been proposed in various states like Ohio, where Stoner joined lawmakers earlier this month to endorse the [“Kidfluencer Protections Act”.](https://www.13abc.com/2024/01/10/toledo-native-former-child-actor-advocates-protections-kidfluencers/)”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm562cgakz2tz70shj90waf)
- "[House Bill 2564](https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/80431), which addresses child performers of all kinds.
