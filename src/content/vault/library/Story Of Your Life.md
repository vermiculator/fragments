summary: The passage is a conversation between two characters discussing their attempts to learn the language of alien creatures called heptapods. They have made progress in understanding the spoken language, but are struggling to decipher the heptapods' writing system, which appears semasiographic in nature. They hope that understanding the heptapods' language will allow them to communicate about topics such as physics and mathematics.

- "some of the logograms looked like the logogram for “heptapod” with some extra strokes added to one side or another. Perhaps their verbs could be written
  as affixes to a noun."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jvsdx703tz9wjcn863bkvx09)
