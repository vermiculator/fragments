- ## Extracts
- "As a paradigm, the commons consists of working, evolving models of self-provisioning and stewardship that combine the economic and the social, the collective and the personal."
- "to honour the commons can risk unpleasant encounters with the power of the Market/State duopoly"
- "commoners realise this \[consumerism, hyper-growth \] is not just a morally deficient, spiritually unsatisfying vision for humanity; it is also a mad utopian fantasy"
- "\[the commons\] invites people to achieve their own bottom-up, do-it-yourself styles of emancipation."
- "it \[the commons\] has little interest in hidebound party politics, rigid ideologies or remote centralized institutions"
- "quiet revolution"
- "Our archaic system of nation-states and international bodies cannot mobilize itself to deal intelligently with a gravely imperiled planetary ecosystem. It resists serious measures to improve social justice and fair distribution."
- to escape their fate as low-paid, bonded laborers, and to remake themselves as self-reliant, proud farmers.

- ## Notes
- quietly building [[alternative systems]] that make the old models obsolete, calling for more transparent governance
- both pragmatic and optimistic
- self-organised, diverse and widespread, but starting to find each other and coordinate their work
