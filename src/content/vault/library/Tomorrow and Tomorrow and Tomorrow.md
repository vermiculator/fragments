this is a fiction but I include it here for its insights on game development, creative interaction and the processes of collaborative work - personal/emotional/experiential insights from fiction I currently keep private - [[its hard to document lessons you learn from art, media, fiction in the wild]]

one 'fictional' creative work discussed is heavily influenced by an uncredited real work. controversies suggests possible issues with Zionism and the author -- references to Judaism in the book are infrequent but possibly questionable -- not relevant to any core themes or plots. CW topics minimal and respectful but I'm using this entry currently to test the use of CWs. Non-graphic medical themes throughout.

## Extracts
- "To design a game is to imagine the the person who will eventually play it" ^59c9bc
- "never use someone else's game engine if you can help it. You cede too much power to them" ^02aa45
- "The simulation was incomplete because it didn't have a call to action. The only feeling a player could have at the end of Sadie's game was nihilism."  ^32c54f
- “And this is the truth of any game—it can only exist at the moment that it is being played. It’s the same with being an actor. In the end, all we can ever know is the game that was played, in the only world that we know.” ^3b7d9f
- "Computers are great for experimentation, but they’re bad for deep thinking."
- "clinging to a few early ideas about a project can cut off the potential for the work" ^70e84e
