- "it’s difficult for us to fully understand their complexities, algorithms, and materialities — how they work feels occluded, which shares its root word with “occult.”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5d65kzs1pp7qzfsa09td7)

In the book [_Habeas Viscus: Racializing Assemblages, Biopolitics, and Black Feminist Theories of the Human_](http://dukeupress.edu/habeas-viscus), Alexander G. Weheliye develops a theory linking race to our understanding of the “human” by describing how racialization disciplines humanity into categories of “full humans, not-quite-humans, and nonhumans.” Within this framework, Blackness designates “a changing system of unequal power structures that apportion and delimit which humans can lay claim to full human status and which humans cannot.” This theory of “human” is precisely what relegated my people to a nonhuman status, to “machines.”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5d69mhqkr5gyc35t6v9n6)
