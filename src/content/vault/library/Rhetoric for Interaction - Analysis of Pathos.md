- "rhetoric can be defined as guidelines to construct effective communication. It can also be seen as a means to provide the audience with motivation for adopting a new attitude or taking a new course of action. It is a tool for achieving goals, generating responses."
- websites often have persuasive intent
- study of verbal rhetoric since Ancient Greece, study of visual rhetoric since mid-20th century, rhetoric of interaction the new form
- using a classical principle from the Aristotelian study of discourse: the rhetorical appeal of pathos
- [[ethos, logos, pathos]]
- rhetorical possibilities of interactive tech appealing to visitors emotions
- "Rhetoric is a dynamic, polysemic term, of which implications vary with time and author"^05ee0d
- Aristotle defined rhetoric as “the faculty of observing \[...] the available means of persuasion”
- Barthes identifies six sides of rhetoric: 
  1) a technique: “an art of persuasion, body of rules and recipes whose implementation makes it possible to convince the hearer of the discourse"/reader of the work
  2) a teaching: rhetoric as introduced into institutions of learning
  3) a science: "a field of observation and classification of language phenomena"
  4) an ethic: "a group of rules with a practical goal and moral code"
  5) a social practice: "a power that allows privileged classes to hold ownership of speech"
  6) a ludic practice, a "black rhetoric" - "games, parodies, erotic or obscene allusions”
- "the difference between dialectic and rhetoric discourses \[is that] the former looks for rationally accepted conclusions, while the latter \[obtains] not only rational agreement, but also emotional adherence from the audience"
- "articulates its own rhetorical [[syllogisms]]—the enthymemes"
- rhetoric's proofs are provided by ethos, logos and pathos, provoking decisions based on emotional argument
- less degree of certainty than logical [[syllogisms]]
- connection only through passively in taking or interacting. Visitors become participants
- an active experience, being an active part of the process
- "The mere pres‐

ence of interactive features indicates a disposition to transfer some control to the visitor, which may contribute to an overall friendliness."
- "how much control the visitors are convinced to have" - so not inherently how much control they have but how much they feel their input affects the output
- "a website can go from resembling a document to be read, to simulating a space to be explored, something to be experienced"
- "Immersive websites bring visitors into the action, the narrative, or the message"
- third or first POV
- what is second person in game/interactive media?
- "the use of the term function, rather than purpose, in order to dissociate the judgment from any possible intention of the object's creator" interesting distinction, [[death of the author]] -  “a work, once done, stands independent of its production and the intentions of artists or creators are irrelevant to critics’ responses to their works” 12
- what emotion does the interaction induce, and which of these emotions lead to actions 
- virtual agents interacting with flat UI as if they can access it the same as us 
- simulating a bond with an animal as a means to care for that animal (to drive donations for the actual animal)
- not necessarily accurate depictions, but to inspire fear. Situated embodiment to enhance reality and presence and immersion
- entering any address and recieving a result brings the problem physically closer and therefore emotionally closer
- I'm not sure I want to evoke negative emotions unless they ARE based in a strong reality. And are alongside a drive for action that is actually maximally achievable. Useful anger, useful fear, not aimless worry and doom.
- unethical to evoke these emotions where unwarranted eg to sell [[unethical marketing]]
- rhetoric possibilities of interaction towards "broadening capabilities of interface designers as to building arguments"
