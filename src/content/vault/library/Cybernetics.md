- "Artificial Intelligence (AI) grew from a desire to make computers smart, whether smart like humans or just smart in some other way. Cybernetics grew from a desire to understand and build systems that can achieve goals"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k7vsbnhjxkp5xywp7wr6f714)
- "I (left) presumes that value lies in understanding "the world as it is" — which presumes that knowing the world is both possible and necessary. Cybernetics (right) holds that it is only necessary and only possible to be coupled to the world sufficiently to achieve goals, that is, to gain feedback in order to correct actions to achieve a goal"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k7vsckqp7et87scypyhas2tw)
