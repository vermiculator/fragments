summary: Ecological Rewriting is a collective, open-access book that remixes The Chernobyl Herbarium through annotations and creative responses.  
Led by Gabriela Méndez Cota and nine collaborators in Mexico, it reframes reuse as "disappropriation" and ties plant-thinking to local histories of nuclear power and activism.  
The project challenges academic norms and offers an experimental online edition linking the new book to the original work.
