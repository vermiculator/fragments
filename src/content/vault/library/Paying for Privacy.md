Empirical evi- dence suggests that users with higher income use privacy- enhancing technologies more frequently and subscribe to ad-free services (Carrascal et al. 2013). In contrast, lower- income users, who are more vulnerable to digital exploita- tion, often lack the economic means to opt out of data-driven advertising models (Andrejevic 2014). This dynamic repro- duces and amplifies existing social inequalities, effectively transforming privacy from a fundamental right into a market commodity."

However, empirical research reveals that despite expressing dissatisfaction with the extrac- tive platform models, users demonstrate significant resistance to cooperative alternatives (Burgess et al. 2018). This inertia is largely due to network effects, as dominant platforms retain users through established social networks and content repositories."

[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzjqj8gpnrvfyn73j6ejd593)
- "Social media monetization strategies reproduce and amplify existing social inequalities through differentiated user experiences on digital platforms. This stratification manifests itself primarily through economic disparities in access to privacy-enhancing tools and ad-free subscription models, allowing affluent users to opt out of surveillance capitalism while restricting lower-income users to ad-supported versions (Andrejevic 2014). This differentiation creates what scholars conceptualize as a ’privacy divide’, in which socioeconomic status determines individuals’ ability to protect personal data from corporate surveillance and commodification (van Dijck et al. 2018). Pinterest’s tiered service model exemplifies this dynamic through premium features that disproportionately serve higher-income demographics."

- "Contemporary scholarship on aspirational labor (Abidin 2018) reveals how users—predominantly women—invest significant resources in content creation and curation while seeking the accumulation of potential economic or social capital. This labor is typically not paid for, generating surplus value that is paid primarily by platform owners rather than content creators (Fuchs 2014).
