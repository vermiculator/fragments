full-title: "In Dishonor Of: The Assemblage of Counter-Memory as Networked Resistance on Twitter"
summary: The study examines the Twitter hashtag \#ArawNgMagnanakaw as a counter-commemoration that pushes back against Marcos-era revisionism. It introduces the "assemblage of counter-memory" — a network of diverse users, discourses, and platform practices that reconstruct marginalized histories and create political agency. Twitter helps connect and amplify these counter-memories, but such online assemblages are often temporary and hard to institutionalize.
