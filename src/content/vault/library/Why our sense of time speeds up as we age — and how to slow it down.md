- "when we are children, we are constantly being introduced to new things and ideas that leave lasting impressions on our memories."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm567anfaz6rtmpb10acdqe)
- "there is evidence that our perception of time as we are experiencing it is also slower when we are very young children."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm567eae9fjmdaabghyw3qq)
- "“Their neural transmission is in effect physically slower compared to adults. This in turn affects how they perceive the passage of time. By the time we are adults, our time circuits are done wiring and we have learned from experience how to correctly encode the passage of time.”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm567gsksw5jcwbqpze768h)
- "when a child, [the brain is still developing](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/video/the-impact-of-electronics-on-a-child-s-brain-1235967043828?v=railb&). Their neurons don't have all their myelin — the insulator on the neuron.”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm567jwa8881akgw080eabr)
- "This lag in real-time time perception doesn’t span beyond early childhood, nor does it play a role in retrospective time-perception"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm567mzvr4vtcrcc6bxavvp)
- "more likely attributed to the fact that children have had less time on the planet, such that a year feels weightier"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm567q5zvwy79dkd61jner1)
- "Introducing novelty into your life when you can will make the memories stand out and stretch time"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm567sv9syxtbg6hnaa8yyx)
- "It’s also a system that mirrors childhood to an extent."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm567w7nmym308qamp3xg6t)
