- more interesting stuff here, want to read and note more thoroughly

- "an autonomous device meant to obey its master: 'robot,' from the 1923 translation of Karel Capek’s 1921 play 'R.U.R.' ((the word robot having been derived from a Czech word for slave, 'robotnik'" -  ^e5d58a
- "the issue of autonomy was particularly germane in cases where synchronization was required" 
- "Another possibility is that the metaphor caught on because it ameliorates a tension between a desire for more autonomous machines and a desire to retain human mastery."
- "By referring to a master/slave relation in devices, professionals may reassure themselves that they will remain masters of machines"
- is it BECAUSE it is more evocative that it is naturally selected from neutral alternatives? same way you remember highs and lows or memorise info better through bawdy analogies
