subtitle: Investigating the Use of Information Creation in Everyday Life
full-title: "Creating by Me, and for Me: Investigating the Use of Information Creation in Everyday Life"

- "to figure out this seemingly predictable yet actually dynamic world, individuals need to interact with information to proceed with life (Savolainen, 1995; 2005). During this interactive process, people usually create and curate information resources that differ in form and nature to satisfy their needs (Linder, et al., 2014; Rosenbaum, 2011; Whittaker, et al., 2000). To this end, it is crucial to investigate the creation of information since it helps people navigate and accomplish life activities (Whittaker, 2011)."

- "we give a detailed analysis of each function of information creation that facilitates our everyday information tasks, demonstrating its potential in making this routine work efficient and engaging."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jz8nbrbfz8v403g2aqx8bk9e)
- "when taking part in grocery shopping and idea collecting, people not only consume but also create information to solve problems and make decision"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jz8ndrey83bfw6hqzww03b9b)
- "grocery shopping is essential in sustaining life, but people tend to collect ideas to satisfy high-level information needs, such as ideation, which usually results in intellectual content (Makri et al., 2019). From these aspects, we argue that concurrently examining the two studies is reasonable and productive to fulfil our goal."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jz8ne9138g3xaxektjkc06mj)
- "We regard information creation as a broad category that results from the keeping-track behaviour (e.g., documenting information) and everyday ideation (e.g., organising information)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jz8nqvs8j5hvb6wmz8vm7q6w)
- "We would like to stress the outcome of information-creating behaviour, that is, the usage of information utilised to create new information. We prefer this facet of information-creating behaviour over its processual perspective in an attempt to examine how created information has helped individuals tackle daily tasks by making them efficient and pleasant."

- "he was specifically interested in finding pictures that included details of a bird’s wings because he was not good at drawing wings. After pinning numerous artistic images of birds on Pinterest, Karl expanded the scope to include images of birds beyond drawings (mostly photographs of birds). The participant stated he did so because photos sparked his interest and he liked his encounters with unexpected information from using the following function on Pinterest: ‘I guess after this ‘Following’ something at certain points, you’ll sometimes find things that you didn’t think you were looking for, but you want to look at it’."

- "This finding is consistent with prior literature, which showed that users organised Pinterest boards for both practical and emotional reasons (Linder, et al., 2014; Lindley, et al., 2013). It also supports previous researchers in personal information management (PIM) who argued that people organised information for possible reuse in the future (Jones, 2012; Narayan, 2014; Whittaker, 2011). We advance such discussion by noting the benefit of unexpected but exciting information (known as information encountering, Erdelez and Makri, 2020) in information creation and its influence on everyday idea collecting"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jz8qs0nb0ecbfyzh71rsh4dw)

- "although using the documentation angle to discuss everyday life tasks is applicable, it may not concurrently capture personal values and the social influence attached to everyday information creation.
  The prevalence of information in daily life does not simply involve people in a series of consumption behaviour like acquiring and maintaining information. Instead, it triggers the practice of creating something new to fit individual life in contemporary society"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jz8qy9dh686f3rba9s5ckw0r)
