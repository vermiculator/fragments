full-title: "Toward a Ludic Architecture: The Space of Play and Games"
short-title: "Toward a Ludic Architecture"
subtitle: "The Space of Play and Games"
summary: The text explores the connections between play, architecture, and dance through the concepts of movement and rhythm. It defines "kinesis" as the specific movements involved in play, emphasizing how these movements relate to spaces and objects. Ultimately, it presents a framework for understanding play as a dynamic activity that involves interactions between players and their environments.

- "the physical concepts of movement and rhythm relate to the psychological concept of “flow” (Csíkszentmihályi 1975), which many consider to be at the core of gameplay situations cap- able of absorbing players (Chen 2007)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkv04tj3tb3z2mr7wvj1cp8f)
- "Flow-inducing activities such as ritual, play, dance, or art facilitate concentration and involve- ment by way of controllable rules, skill learning, attached goals, and feedback (Csíkszentmihályi 1991:72) – the type of flow that results, we see, is more related to formalized, game-like activities than to playful activities."

- "urban planning theorist Kevin Lynch (1960) con- cerns himself with the look of cities and the way they present themselves to their dwellers as coherent, visible, and clear – in total, as beautiful and highly “imageable.” Lynch suggests that certain large-scale design ele- ments can heighten the city’s legibility and facilitate, for example, orient- ation."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkv06c4ynh34gvx6x15b4aet)
- "Lynch’s suggested design elements for achieving this “imageability” include clear, coherent, and visible “paths” (e.g. streets, canals, railroads), “edges” (walls, shores), “districts,” “nodes” (squares, street corner hangouts), and “landmarks” (points of reference such as towers and domes) (Lynch 1960:46ff.). This choice of elements reflects Lynch’s belief that fundamentally, “a city is sensed in motion” (Lynch 1960:107)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkv06vdmqfw2qfavxrd5zxyd)

- "glorifies tempo and movement (Trüby 2003), but neither as means to create a relationship between a space and a user nor as means to achieve a Genius Loci, a holistic, site-specific, unique architectural characteristic. Rather, Koolhaas sees tempo and movement as expres- sions of globalization that assure constant change and the promise of (or excuse for) generic architectures without predefined programs (Koolhaas 2003)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkv09smgngk2b20chw8kh2fd)
- "For Koolhaas and his concept of the Generic City, it is not only the rhythm of spatial impressions that defines architecture, but also the rap- id rhythm of change that dictates how an urbanity should be designed so that it can accommodate both that change itself and the movements caus- ing it."

T"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkv0ds83nhgnp9xfaerbahax)
- "Design drafts for buildings are programmed to achieve “individuality through movement” (Hovestadt 2006:78); CNC machines are employed to “print” pavilions; and networked, programmable structures and functions not only solve spatial composition problems, but also allow for emergent and adaptable (we can say: rhythmical) systems in architecture in building services, for example."

- "although these philosophies are distinguishable as design rhetorics, we are proposing that all are im- plicitly or explicitly based on the following intrinsic assumptions: Architectural Movement Architectural movement is a relocation process of one or more subjects, objects, or spaces in space over time.
  Architectural Rhythm Architectural rhythm is the variation of measured movements in space over time."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkv0f7nr2n1akt6wc1yyxv8p)

- "Kinetography Laban or Labanotation, a movement nota- tion system similar to music notation that “indicate[s] the accurate rhythm of movement” (Hutchinson 1977:3). It is particularly intended for the field of dance and generally aims to analyze and “record objectively the changes in the angles of the limbs, the paths in space, and the flow of energy [as well as] movement motivation and the subtle expression and quality” (1977:4)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkv0hzqv3fr9exhwt2vptvh3)
- "Labanotation holds that movement is the result of the release of energy through a mus- cular response to an inner or outer stimulus that produces a visible result in time and space. Note that Laban’s notation does not record the initial stimulus or the exact muscular response; instead, the change produced by muscular action is recorded."

- "language of expressive gestures."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkv1jjvwv0hg63y31ymqbc8w)
- "Laban’s system assumes that the purpose of any action may be to relate to one’s own body, another person, an object, or a space (or part of space). The notion of rhythm, eventually, is linked to translating a basic recurrent beat or rhythmic pattern in music into physical action (1977:16)."

- "a more general and more dia- lectical way to look at play through the lens of dance. First, a stimulus – which can be a solo event, a beat, or a rhythmic pattern – provides the player with something to respond to or with which to synchronize; in re- sponse to this stimulus, the player enacts a movement. This movement (or rhythm) places the player in a novel relation to another player, an ob- ject, or a space, possibly triggering a response."

- "In particular with regard to pervasive games that increasingly involve physical body movements, Loke et al. demonstrate how to use Labanotation as an analysis tool and potential game design tool."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkv1rn9tf0fd1245fyq9dbdj)

- "Dialectic thinking embodies a speculative Denkbewegung – in English, a thinking movement. This movement be- gins when one thinks about something that exists. Then, from the start- ing point, a difference or ”other” emerges. The movement eventually manages to overcome this difference, thereby producing new knowledge and a new starting point.
