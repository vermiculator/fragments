title: "More People Movers"
full-title: "More People Movers"
short-title: "More People Movers"
summary: I did a video about Seoul last year, and one of the elements that I think is most interesting is how many "people movers" — really automated light metros and frequently locally-called "light rail" — exist across the region.

- "the people mover is a band-aid solution for poor planning"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55t2gytf56wj0v6pkm8f4)
- "many of the lines actually act as infill urban transit, operating like a light subway line in an area that is poorly connected or dense enough to justify even more service."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55t4kbh3trvkdg9w00ksj)
- "Since Seoul is extremely dense and hilly, this kind of role would be a struggle for trams, and while the city _does_ do buses at an almost unbelievable scale (Seoul is easily the most underrated BRT city), once you experience a constant stream of diesel buses along a street you realize it is an imperfect solution."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55t6mr8pnxj6chw4jefmx)
- "the connections will be much better that what could have been offered by buses, and arguably higher capacity than the light rail service, since people movers should be able to operate at extremely high frequency."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55t92007xb66h0q06meva)
- "cities in Japan have all manner of monorails and people mover lines _augmenting_ the conventional heavy rail and subway systems"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55tb125jpw7vqt0f09dw9)
- "In Asia, people movers feel like _less_ of a crutch and more a flexible tool that can bring fixed guideway transit to places where it would be challenging for conventional rail."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55td1fj43rn8v7zbv98c8)
- "Acknowledging that people movers often exist to try and mitigate problematic conditions, I think it's interesting to ask what we could do if we had more! While I certainly would rather major universities, hospitals, airports, and shopping centres be directly served by rapid transit, if they are not, a people mover could still be a serious improvement on the status quo."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55tf3n66a2j8bhg8rnwqv)
- "people movers often feel like they are used by cities as a crutch, connecting places that _should_ be on the rapid transit network but were missed for one reason or another, be it a rapid transit line that didn't stop where it should have, or a major development sited off of the transit network."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55th872dcee9q3sd11xwp)
- "while a people mover is less convenient or capacious than a direct high-capacity rail link (likely delivered by shifting an alignment to hit a major destination), they still do offer a big boost for transit as a lightweight connecting service that can provide high frequency, and thanks to automation usually has low operating costs."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55tkasjxm8zan3f92ztd2)
- "like with light metro, people movers let you emphasize frequency instead of vehicle size, creating a better system — especially for inevitable transfers."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55tnazvvyyjrpp115cn5d)
