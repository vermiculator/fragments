short-title: "Speculative Everything"
subtitle: "Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming"
status: ARCHIVED
summary: The book "Speculative Everything" explores how designers can use fictional worlds and thought experiments to imagine alternative futures. It emphasizes the importance of creativity and social imagination in design, moving beyond traditional methods to challenge the present. By embracing speculation, designers can inspire new perspectives on societal issues rather than just predicting the future.
