- "Rather than following representationalist [1](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/348066802/#page-14-0) belief that representations are ontologically distinct from what they represent, screenshots give account of how these phenomena are dependent, intra-actively

Distributed with them are metadata and other material practices that involve technologies, skills, interfaces and habits, often in form of gestures that are performed on and with the help of computational devices. These are screenshot situations"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k24qf0tanpdxj6s7ftcqdxq8)

[⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k24qh15aka0pvsmk5fh4vm6k)
- "The moment of making an image, which in this case is the event of screen capture, initiates a process of executions that require specific socio-technological conditions that reproduce screenshot situations computationally"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k24qhmt7v86m75n6r14ctqyx)

Matthew Allen discusses the application of screenshots for architecture by situating them "in contexts of practice" and as "figures of knowledge" that define the practice ( [Allen 2020,](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/348066802/#page-14-0) p. 103)."

- "Using conceptual steganography, based on the cryptographic practice of concealing messages in another message or an object, Luxemburg plays with its possibilities as conceptual artistic practice and asks: "What would an image that contains a novel actually show? What would the code look like? Could the code be the image, and the image the code? And so on…."

 - is this remix? direct encapsulation of a part
- "Screenshots discussed here are confusing as they construct a picture as imaginary "pulsating with life" and "suggesting the motion and vitality that is captured, even in the still image, the material excess that turns the virtual image into a real picture" ( [Mitchell](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/348066802/#page-15-0) [2005](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/348066802/#page-15-0) , p."

- "*The Conceptual Crisis of Private Property as a Crisis in Practice* is a noise of formats and representations that all seem to be equally important and brought to the front to capture our attention. As they are all assembled together into an image and as an image, they also create its depth."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k24t0nsa6933agvwvwm7fnn9)
- "It is not much different from what is traditionally expected from an image, a representation superimposed onto a surface and nested within a frame. It is at this point that the viewer is challenged to look beyond the visual and focus on computational functions inserted in the image."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k24t1rmwwbq0sw41xpg0gbes)
- "The screenshot as a unit of measure maps the image as a multidimensional space between the virtual materiality of a computer, symbolism of visual culture, and wide-spanning effects of digitalisation. What is assembled exists across dimensions which are differently available to algorithms and to people."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k24t22yvg3t0m0rj375wgfbj)
 - multimodal as redundancy

- "The fact that this image can be executed and that it contains other executable formats moves it beyond the representational dimension of what normally is defined as an image."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k24t32vrbhjmadba3n6hs04e)
- "And at the same time, it is a representation, a mirror on what an image is computationally."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k24t405smr23ensgmf4eck1j)
- "screenshots are situations that capture the circulation of data at the moment when data materialises as an image."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k24tczhsd7c8vy0h1fy7ka3r)
- "I position the networked image not as a new category of images but rather as a specific and located agential force – a situation that organises relations and bodies that come together to make an image."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k24tdxq570zvpj88se4d64cr)
- "See also Lozana Rossenova (Chapter 11, this volume), who defines screenshots also in regard to data and metadata describing screenshot images, thus making them accessible online. Rossenova locates screenshots networked potential in "relations between backend, frontend and user agent.""  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k24tev1dns9rjprszdc28vfj)
