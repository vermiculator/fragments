 Extracts
- "The nation is a smokescreen, a fantasy which hides the struggle between classes which exists within and across them." ^5ebca1
- "For us, as revolutionaries, [[how to make change|meaningful action]] is whatever increases the confidence, autonomy, initiative, participation, [[solidarity]], egalitarian tendencies and self-activity of the masses, and whatever assists in their demystification. Sterile and harmful action is whatever reinforces the passivity of the masses, their [[apathy]], [[cynicism]], differentiation through [[hierarchical domination|hierarchy]], [[alienation]], reliance on others to do things for them, and the degree to which they can therefore be manipulated by others, even those acting on their behalf."
