 - I can't articulate it right now but don't think this is true, there are many other mechanisms

- "George Maciunas and the Fluxus artists embraced games for their very lowliness. Games provided a sort of “ludus populi,” a play of the people that provided the perfect platform for bringing art to a mass audience. The making of FluxKits and FIuxGames was itself a kind of game: create play patterns from found, e.g., “readymade” objects; create kits that can be reproduced easily and sold cheaply."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jjmjm94thvb846y7y7vx9y8a)
- "Digital art, by definition, is not a “thing.” It does not exist within the “art-as-object” paradigm, but exists as pure “score.” With digital art, score means code, and code is at once something and nothing. It does not “exist,” except in a conceptual sense, until played. It thus eludes the tradi- tional methods for assigning economic value to art"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jjmjpa4365j5rrcpsv130def)
- "How do we monetize a conceptual ready- made object, versus a handcrafted “work of art?”"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jjmjpxsadg0ptchfnfff9bqs)
- "The fact that the art is itself made of pixels and code, purely instructions, pure “score,” without an overt physical manifestation, completely reframes the distribution infrastructure, the economic equation and the gate- keeping authority of the art world."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jjmjqk780mecqhswd794xjjv)
- "game art is available via the Internet as free downloads, creating a self-prop a- c*»t•›, ii.

- "Open Source culture also has a
  long-standing tradition of collaboration, collectivism and multiple author- i s i a r r r • »

- "Open Source philosophy is based on
  these premises: a) that code belongs to everyone, b) that everyone should have access “under the hood,” c) that people should be able to extend a program's functionality and d) that those new features should then be returned to col- lective ownership so others can use them."

- "many Pc games today come bundled with game editing tools. Players are free to build their own game levels, create “patches” (small programs that sit within existing games), “skins,” (textures that change the appearance of existing games, sort of like digital wallpaper), and even build their own new games from scratch to run on the underlying

- "the term “patch” is used to describe a plug-in that sits on top of another game, which makes them ideal for interventional strategies.
