- why imitate paper?
- parenthesis and footnotes as ideas escaping
- multi-threaded, tangential paths
- serial progression, imposing a chronology 
- deep linkage, marginal notes
- new medium as expansion, [[parallelism]] 
- [[history as parallel narrative]]
- the origins of content
- andy matuschak [[peripheral notes]]
- now peripheral media, peripheral experience 
- transclusion, same content in two places, not represented by two structures
- can only click one link at a time, local graphs, many tabs open
- find the original context if any soundbite or shot
- 'literature as it always should've been'
- 'simultaneously the reader and writer'
- 'windowed' style privileges fragmentation, indeterminacy, variation, emphasises process rather than finished/ complete object
