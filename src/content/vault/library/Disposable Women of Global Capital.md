## Notes
- How Judith Butler talks on the body as producing itself over and over, how the social subjects are always in production, on the intersectionality as fundamental as parts cannot be materially separated, people are never complete, I don't quite understand the passage but this is what i gathered from it 13to14
- Why then, with the above, is the corporeality broadly 'female' and 'third world', 'third world' as a concept of persistent underdevelopment 
- a 'coherent social subject' but treated as 'conceptually inferior' 
- This analysis does not call for 'identity politics ' approach, as this identity is not overtly held, and working people around the world have rare opportunity for common ground 
- 'As feminist geographer Doreen Massey has written, global capitalism exposes the strategic need for Creating coalitions with distant others across the spectrum of spatialized identities (Massey 2004)' 
- 'the myth of the disposable third world woman exposes the dire need for forming alliances between the consumers and the producers of global capitalist goods'
- 'to sabotage the myth is to strike a blow at the numerous hierarchies that rely upon its constant repetition'
