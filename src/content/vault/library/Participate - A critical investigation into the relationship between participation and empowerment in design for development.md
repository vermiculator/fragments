full-title: Participate! A critical investigation into the relationship between participation and empowerment in design for development
summary: The article examines the connection between participatory design methods and empowerment in development projects, questioning the assumption that these methods always lead to empowerment for marginalized communities. It highlights the need for designers to critically assess their approaches and understand the limitations and context of participatory methods. The author suggests that clearer definitions and better research are necessary to ensure that design efforts genuinely contribute to empowerment and sustainable development.

- ‘Participatory facilitators’ are often perceived as ‘outsiders’ 
- "one may even argue that our efforts are unethical and indeed neocolonialist in nature."
- what is it to help, to assume they don't have the capacity themselves
- ‘Empowering to’ or ‘empowering through’ no real consistent meaning of empowerment
- considered top-down and bottom-up approaches rather than aimless loose bottom-up as default
- what are we changing and why, what dynamic are we introducing to an existing community
- need more initial contextual research
- ‘symbolic violence’ 
- lost in translation
