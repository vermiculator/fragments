- "technology is too important to be left to technologists"
- "technology is part of what makes us human"
- "Only some of us create technology but we all use it, and we all have it used on us, sometimes without our knowledge and consent"
- "Technology is the interface between citizens and governments, between consumers and companies, and between humans and the planet."
- "Even when we are not interested in technology, technology is interested in us."
- "Many of the most valuable and influential companies in the world are technology companies. "
- "A growing number of governments have a digital services arm, the job of which is to create ways for us to access health, tax, passport and other services online, minimizing the need to set foot in any physical premises."
- "Companies and governments are also working together to create digital identities for us, make our cities "smart", and transform our civilian and defence infrastructure into a hybrid of the physical and digital.
- "To ignore technology is a decision - one that turns us into a cog in someone else's machine."
- "This decision places us at the mercy of the 'true professionals', hoping they will not harm us."
- "passive role in our own lives"

- "through the lens of physics, we are elemental"
- on DNA - "our 'code' is unique to us."
- "We are also social creatures who exist in a network of relationships and in history, not in isolation. We are the product of our environment, our experiences, and our choices. Some of this is out of our control, some of it is down to us. We, in turn, both individually and collectively, shape the environment, experiences and choices of others."
