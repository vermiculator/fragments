## Extracts
- "If, during early development, a living thing comes to understand that it is helpless, it will continue to perceive a lack of control, no matter if the context changes."
- "Our feelings are always in the past,” says John Sharp, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. “This is something that’s really outlived its adaptive value.” As an adult I *should* have control over my current situation, but I don’t."
- "While we might be able to temporarily stave the flow of conflict by falling asleep, we’re not really *escaping* anything. In fact, sleep in some ways forces us to not only relive the emotional experience but to process and concretize it"
- "You can be driven to sleep simply by having a lot of emotional memories to process."
- "sleep disruption may prevent consolidation of potentially therapeutic memories, sometimes termed “fear extinction” memories. These are memories that can dull the effect of a traumatic experience by creating more positive associations with specific triggers"
- "Ever wonder why little kids nap so much? Researchers believe that it’s not just because they’ve been running around all day—it’s also due to the fact their short-term memory storage space is so small, and they constantly need to unload experiences and consolidate memories more often"
