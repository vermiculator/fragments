summary: This study examines how messaging platforms can reduce privacy harms from screenshotting private messages. It finds that hiding message content during screenshots and clear privacy rules lower screenshot taking and sharing. The research suggests design changes can protect users and shift social norms about message privacy.

- "Petronio (2002) conceptualizes privacy boundaries as metaphorical lines to distinguish between public and private information. CPM asserts people form these boundaries as a result of their recognition of ownership and desire for control over private information. Receivers of shared information are designated as information “co-owners.” Once a collective boundary is formed with a co-owner, a rule-based management system governs the co-responsibility of shared information. The co-owner is responsible for following privacy rules regarding who else can know the information (boundary linkage rules) and how much of it can be shared (boundary permeability rules). A breakdown in this privacy management effort—or disruption to established boundaries, rules, and dynamics of information ownership and control— defines privacy turbulence (Petronio, 2002). CPM frames the breaking of established privacy rules as a natural component of the privacy management life cycle (Petronio, 2002), after which information owners recalibrate their privacy management strategy (Steuber & McLaren, 2015)."

- "Engagement in screenshot collection and sharing demonstrates a false sense of ownership over co-owned information. Petronio (2002) refers to this as the “pretend factor,” where co-owners feel they have a right to share information that is not theirs. Although the pretend factor was developed in the context of interpersonal gossip (i.e., quoting a previous conversation), the validity attributed to screenshots of messages gives these records more weight than information recall (Yadav et al., 2023). The pretend factor is amplified when a secondary tool (e.g., the screenshot feature; audio recorder) surreptitiously captures records without permission, thereby creating a new record under the newfound ownership of the co-owner. When people sense a higher level of ownership over co-owned information, they are more likely to share it in the future (McNealy & Mullis, 2019)."

- "Petronio (2002) defends that privacy turbulence may occur if rules are misinterpreted by the co-owner, creating “fuzzy” boundaries (Petronio, 2002). She argues when rules are explicit, co-owners are less likely to create privacy turbulence. This may include specifically telling a conversation partner not to spread information beyond the confines of the communication platform. Venetis et al. (2012) found more than half of their participants who had previously experienced privacy turbulence failed to provide an explicit privacy rule. As such, co-owners may be less likely to use the screenshot feature to collect and share a digital message when an explicit privacy rule is conveyed by the information owner."

- "Through their behind-the-scenes business practices and design (e.g., affordances, stagnant features), platforms create non-negotiable privacy rules that override individual desires for privacy. For instance, by instituting preventative features (Bhandari et al., 2021) and guidelines (Chandrasekharan et al., 2017), platforms can constrain harmful behaviors. Shore and Prena (2023) argue platforms have the power to foster rules that prioritize user privacy, proposing “platform rules” as an extension of CPM."

- "Messaging platforms allow the screenshot feature to extend the lifetime of already persistent conversations by creating and storing a replicated version of the record. The screenshot feature exacerbates persistence on messaging platforms by capturing an out-of-context snippet of a conversation for storage in one’s camera roll and beyond. Due to the screenshot feature, users may not fully trust the privacy supposed to be afforded by ephemeral messaging (Waddell, 2016)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4xeq25s5gkx3yg385f0ka81)
- "Obscurity directly targets persistence by constraining messages received by the co-owner from persisting either (a) within their private camera roll or (b) through further dispersion. Hartzog (2018) promotes obscurity to enhance privacy by allowing less transparent access to specific, sensitive information. Hartzog and Stutzman (2013) define obscurity as “a context in which information is relatively difficult to find or understand” (p. 388). Of note, obscurity of information does not imply anonymity. One may be able to deduce who information belongs to while not knowing the specifics of what such information is."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4xert6rck9rgtd83akytby5)

- "Participants generally followed the explicit rule set by their conversation partner when it instructed them not to share the information beyond the confines of the conversation. These findings align with Venetis et al. (2012), who found individuals were more likely to experience privacy turbulence when an explicit privacy rule was not clearly asserted."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4xfd0fth5pewqwc3101f3wa)
- "competing evidence around the efficacy of Snapchat’s screenshot accountability cue raises questions about the strength of ephemeral communication. Research has shown the appeal of platforms such as Snapchat given its ephemerality, which diminishes self-consciousness and encourages playfulness within social interactions (Xu et al., 2016). The screenshot feature challenges ephemeral communication through making content persistent. In line with Bayer et al. (2015), this study showcases that accountability for violating ephemerality norms is not sufficient. Future research should continue to explore strategies to encourage ephemeral digital channels akin to face-to-face communication which allow individuals to discuss intimate topics at zero cost (Hollan & Stornetta, 1992)."

- "platforms can communicate an explicit privacy rule through creating a “Confidentiality Mode,” which Ingber (2024) proposes as being able to nudge users against collecting screenshots of private communications ex-ante. Through this design enhancement, users would be reminded by the platform—as opposed to their conversation partner— that certain types of communication are meant to be private. Moreover, it would clarify any “fuzzy” boundaries that spur privacy turbulence (McNealy & Mullis, 2019) and serve as a reminder against the pretend factor. “Confidentiality Mode” would be particularly useful in group messaging, where it is more difficult to ensure privacy rules are understood by the entire group (Mansour & Francke, 2021). Explicit cues indicating antinormative behavior have proven successful when used to combat harassment (Bhandari et al., 2021)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4xfe5qsdx6er8x6xpekvfem)

- "A conceptual limitation of this study was defining screenshot sharing as the transport of the message from a co-owner to a single third party. In reality, third parties can continue to share screenshots with additional people without a connection to the initial information owner. In fact, this behavior is likely because a third party has no connection to the original conversation and thus lacks knowledge of the information owner’s privacy rules (Petronio, 2002). The domino effect of privacy turbulence, including the weakened impact of privacy rules as information spreads, should be examined in future research."

  people can capture private messages using a second device or by installing third party applications. These workarounds should not be targeted, as there are instances where private messages are needed as evidence of harassment (Citron, 2022).
