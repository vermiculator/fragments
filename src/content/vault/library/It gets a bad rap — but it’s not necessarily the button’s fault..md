- "the genius of the drinking fountain button is that it’s modularly repairable.That whole mechanism is part of a self-contained cartridge that’s easy to remove and swap out."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55rhp23rz0tacmqrw0v94)
- "One of the company’s owners used to carry a little screwdriver around everywhere they went to fix dribbling fountains — if you want to try it yourself, Epker says a 1/8-inch flat-blade screwdriver is the largest that will fit."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55rm7rwertghgqps3s5hx)
- "Modern ones even have dedicated filters to keep their internals from clogging as quickly, and a screwdriver hole that lets anyone with a small screwdriver adjust the height of the stream — by changing the maximum distance the seal moves away from the internal water port."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55rpg2bd0vz30y0bnta80)
- "They’re harder to vandalize, too, with no lever to break off and a silver (or copper) disc cover that just spins in place if you try to twist it. Yet they’re still easily repairable: Haws [patented a version in 2006](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6981692B2) that lets a repairperson easily remove the button and access the cartridge with a single special wrench."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55rrvwj5pg4t01ndx3951)
- "I’m beginning to think it’s not the drinking button’s fault; they’re actually some of the most elegant buttons out there. They’re one of the few remaining buttons where your push directly and mechanically controls the result. They’re over a hundred years old."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55rv82mqa74y9gs9f9741)
- "When your thumb pushes that metal disc inward, you’re also pressing a button _beneath_ the button that uncaps a spout _inside_ the spout. There’s a seal inside that blocks the flow of water when the button’s sticking out and releases it when you press down. Pushing down moves the seal that normally covers a tiny waterspout inside the mechanism, letting the water through. Then, it’s free to move, fill up the inside of the faucet, and shoot out the fountain at around 0.4 gallons per minute."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55rxcvghrxh8qb3w1dfmh)
