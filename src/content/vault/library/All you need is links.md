title: "All you need is links"
summary: When Tim Berners Lee talks about how he designed the web, he uses an analogy from physics, describing his process as a quest to find 'fundamental laws' which can generate a desired system - One of the beautiful things about physics is its ongoing quest to find simple rules that describe the behavior of very small, simple objects. Once found, these rules can often be scaled up to describe the behavior of monumental systems in the real world. […]

- "Triples allow computers to do complex automated reasoning. You can even use them to derive relationships that aren’t explicitly stated."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55kmwzre40jnk1bbev2s7)
- "design as a quest to discover a simple set of primitives, **[a small alphabet](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/provoking-emergence-with-alphabets)** for generating a system."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55kt3961ee3deey8jnjgh)
- "Object metaphors are powerful, both because they leverage something familiar to introduce something new, and because they lean into our natural cognitive strengths for spatial reasoning and object manipulation."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55kwsws892em7apard73t)
- "What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it."

- "**Inbound links can be used as a signal of quality**. People are more likely to link to things that matter, and less likely to link to things that don’t."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55m1pbzx2n27xegdhz7yg)
- "We could say that the comment _points to_ the post, or something in the post. That’s a directional relationship."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55m43x5m91mp59jydg6xp)

- "knowledge graphs are tremendously useful for computers, but not so fun to write by hand. If you ask me, [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic%5FWeb) efforts have repeatedly stubbed their toe on this mismatch between symbolic alignment and the messy, emergent, imprecise, _human_ process of knowledge construction."

- "**A hyperlink is a triple where the subject is the page, the predicate is the link text, and the object is the thing being linked to**."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55mcmbjrahvqn16tb5nrx)
- "I create a link because it solves my problem as an author of pointing you, the reader, to a concept."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55mf543w7tr1ba5wrq6xn)
- "Pull out a list of links from a page, and you approximately have the topics for the page. Collect all the links across pages, rank them by frequency, and you have a sense of the most frequently addressed topics within the collection."

- "Hypertext can represent all the interconnections an author can think of, and compound hypertext can represent all the interconnections _many_ authors can think of, as we shall see."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm55mn9m518hhf73p9v2fm1)
