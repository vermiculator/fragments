## Themes
- profiting from others' misfortunes
- life coaching and its ethics
- what is love (baby don't hurt me)

- ## Extracts
- "the wrong thoughts, not circumstances, lead to depressive feelings risks absolving society of any wrongdoing that might have caused our depression to begin with" ^58a38f
- "The crucial difference between AA and life coaching is that in the former, [[communal healing|recovery is necessarily communal]]" ^d1acc2
- "Another important difference is that AA is free. While life coaching as a therapeutic model may not be inherently harmful, it reproduces the ideology of the [[growth at all costs|profit motive]]."
- "Promoting myself as competitive and attractive “on the market” seemed anathema to my conception of love as an understanding of mutual brokenness."
- "love is a [[gift economy]]: It gives without expecting a return on investment. Inefficient, interdependent, pointless, patient, kind."
