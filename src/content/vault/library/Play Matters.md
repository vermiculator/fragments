- what are video games for
- needs input from technical, artists, philosophers, everyone
---
- a lot of this below is very evident through playing ttrpgs. made very explicit in consent and context and playspace etc
- i wonder if ttrpgs and larping have pushed the scholarship on play and game design further than any other medium of game
- paper games and social games and book games and those prison-safe game books (find the link)
- play as creating and expression - word games and poetry, 'the art of conversation' and spoken play, like riddles and jokes
---
- Apollonian and Dionysiac -- read this stuff and learn about Greek tragedy
- is social media the modern carnival? is where we do satire etc, what is the physicial spatial equivalent? stand-up, drag shows etc
- for something to go from play to game it has to have shared rules but do the goals have to be the same? i often comment we aren't playing this for the same reasons, i have fun when i lose too
---
- fandom and media discussion outside of analysis is often just the shape that play takes
- internet as playground
- 'playing with my toys' language of Tumblr atm
- creation play with fanart, fanfics, AUs, OCs, shipping, etc

- in classic theories "playing is a pretense, requiring a particular attitude decoupled from reality, so it would always be possible for participants to disengage with the activity. But play is not detached from the world; it lives and thrives *in* the world. So how do we play between excessive order and compulsive destruction?"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhz7m787x838gyarmrp9w94m)
	- why is this not true? i don't understand this response, surely consent is required for play? or is this the game/play distinction again, is this why dark play can involve others without consent

- "Laughter and the carnival give us an instrument against seri- ousness, restoring the “ambivalent wholeness” that is opposite the institutions we live in."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhz7y433nagz6dfg02n0cqh5)

---
- "The play object, be it a game or a toy, is just a prop for play.
