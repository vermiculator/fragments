- "Maria Popova, who started writing a blog in 2006—now called *[The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/)*—which collects her reading across literature, philosophy, psychology, the sciences. Her blog feels like leisurely research, to me, because it’s an accumulation of curious, semi-directed reading, which over time build up into a dense network of references and ideas—supported by previous reading, and enriched by her own commentary and links to similar ideas by other thinkers."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qc2ant4eqyfbn5y7xnx74)
- "disappointed by some of the actual *interfaces* being produced by the ivory tower"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qd3v825h3xn1ghtr7q62m)
- "There’s [Geoffrey Litt](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/), whose [independent research lab](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) publishes well-researched, thoughtful online articles about computing, software, and interfaces. And [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) is an interesting example; he’s an independent researcher who solicits community funding through Patreon to conduct research on novel user interfaces."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qdc7k4xv0qqhj69fzr7q9)
- "pretty much every writer, essayist, “cultural critic,” etc—especially someone who’s writing more as a vocation than a profession—has research as their leisure activity"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qdmm2x4kzga2gwaefaf41)
- "the best content on the internet is created by people who have turned research into their leisure activity."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qdx0a784k45cmvdcjzz6j)
- "When I was a young teenager on tumblr, basically everyone I followed and looked up to adhered to the following archetypes:"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qesv7qzekfk6bdbnc8qe6)
- "A woman who just wanted to buy a bra and ended up becoming an expert on Edwardian corsetry (and, by extension, early 20th century sartorial techniques, the labor struggles of the English garment industry, and all kinds of vaguely related topics)"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qeb39jqy9cmpsnpkwrqqb)
- "Someone who started off posting scans of obscure Japanese fashion magazines and ended up, essentially, becoming an amateur archivist of 1990s fashion editorials that are exclusively preserved on an obscure tumblr or Livejournal"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qehr87ktm57qr1bjbewnp)
- "autodidacts are responsible for all that is good and great about alternative culture."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qfd2vngvk5ttkh88mt3hn)
- "in the discourse of our times, people with “autistic special interests”—but I kind of hate this term, as it implies that the desire to autodidactically develop expertise in a field and share it with others is an unusual desire, instead of a deeply human one…and it seems part of a broader cultural trend to restrict and even pathologize fairly common human experiences into discrete identity categories"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qfz396mjpn8nb7fpcq9sw)
 - calling something autistic does NOT dehumanise it -- and yes overpathologisation can be a problem -- but a better framing of this might be that neurodiversity produces different forms of research and that we can better enable these methods that are engaged with more by marginalised identities. you are equally producing a new discrete identity category of 'autodidacts', you're just uncomfortable with being compared to autistic people, perhaps?

- "telescoping out into bigger-picture concerns."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qvjc92kwvn0p2jrj9qz36)
 - this also speaks of known autistic thinking styles

- "ou can go deeper and deeper into a narrow topic, one that seems fascinatingly trivial and end up learning about the big peer:"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw9qwqy3eq8azgdk1z7sxn9b)
