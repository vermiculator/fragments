- "effective models. Named Graphs use quadruples and are fully compliant with RDF and SPARQL standards. They support multiple serialization formats, such as TriG, TriX, and N-Quads, and are scalable, which makes them highly suitable for var­ious applications, including Digital Humanities and scholarly data."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2hy2a2k4wrcd0fnr3qz5874)
- "OCDM captures provenance snapshots, including validity dates, re­ sponsible agents, primary sources, and SPARQL update queries, making it a robust solution for manag­ing evolving data."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2hy4gfshhah60gp9c633nqw)
- "Conjectural Graphs are particularly useful in domains like the Arts and Humanities, where repre­senting uncertain or evolving claims without asserting them as facts is essential."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2hy53aj5qdm98mdyfdh9v4s)
- "granularity, allowing for the classification of statements into different vocabulary"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2hya33k6jypeedvv5c3xpg1)
- "translation of statements into different levels of truth or certainty, but they still require additional interpretative"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2hya7mzz5qky5975xr3jq4q)
- "expressing statements with­out asserting them,"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2hy89tm3mt11qkrbekhhraf)
- "==Conjectural Graphs==, in contrast, explicitly structure statements as conjectural rather than asserted by introducing new predicate URIs that isolate the conjectured statement from the dataset’s asserted portion. This allows competing or uncertain claims to be represented without treating them as established facts, making them particularly useful in the context of Digital Humanities and cul­tural heritage research."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2hyck3mxt07ea0qcc53ydcc)
- "must balance practical con­siderations such as the volume and variability of the data, the complexity of uncertain or even contested knowledge, and the need for interoperability by com­ plying with existing standards."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2hydbf97nt2r5fbmt5mws4a)
