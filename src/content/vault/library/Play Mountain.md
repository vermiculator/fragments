- I'm much more interested in the environment of play than specifics of games so Noguchi is more the sort of artist i need to look at in this context
- wanted to make art that 'lives in the world'
- change the landscape people move through
- 'wanted people to feel like the first person on earth, the first person to explore earth'
- be more mindful of space and how we occupy it
- no rules - play not game
- encourage open-mindedness and curiosity
- he also thought of it as a kid, also an outsider
- play structures and playscapes
- based on memories of childhood - for belonging
- how do i get access to inner plans of the point??
- 'the design of childhood'
- four s, plonked down on asphalt in chain link fence
- 658 standard playgrounds in new york, woooof
- the children didn't need instructions to play
- slides etc, only one way to play with them, no room for interpretation
- 'non-directive play'
- change the way people move and think
- what do playgrounds look like for adults when we really consider their baggage and hurting bodies and relationships to responsibility/safety/independence
- contour playground
- 'garden of the moon'![](https://www.grimshaw.foundation/media/pages/stories/noguchi-s-playscapes/fdb5d72c2c-1640361909/25.jpg)

- mixed heritage, linking with others, sides of the war, rounded up, camps on Native-American reservation land.
- put public services and leisure places in design for internment camps
- what does it mean to live and feel alive - playgrounds a crucial part
- chose to live there. 'strange hopefulness'
- the people there were quite clearly prisoners -- his special privileges meant he was untrustworthy, but the staff also treated him like any other prisoner - wasn't able to leave.
- 'here time has stopped and nothing is of any consequence,'
- can you find joy under internment - it is essentially inhumane and cannot be improved - how can you think about play when there is so much cruelty?

- 'abstractionist' strand, movement of playground design
- 'you can play with an abstract form any way you want, play with it any way you'd like'
- it can be anything you'd like
- schemas and mental models kids have for certain kinds of spaces and kinds of play
- stopped by the 80s, movement went underground because of health and safety, concrete forms and consumer safety standards were incredibly restrictive
- approved certified playground safety inspectors
- there are ways to make interesting playgrounds that are safe enough!
- too detailed rulebooks now, no room for variation
- 'post and platform playgrounds' at least some variety, more than four s
- work with landscape architects
- 'destination playgrounds'
- working with new materials, more affordable
- but custom playgrounds are still expensive
- 'to look around with wide eyes, to feel with outstretched fingers, and imagine infinite possibilities'
- "fun just for me, a tactile, full body experience that allows you to be an aestheticizing adult and a go-for-it kid at the same time."
- "Blown up to a slightly ridiculous scale, Moerenuma can only ever be a fantasy island, never a catalyst, which is what we ask today of grand urban parks. As much as I admire its effects, my visit now feels like a mirage."
