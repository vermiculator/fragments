summary: A study of 227 women found no clear link between using Pinterest and actual diet or exercise behaviors. Pinning health content was tied to higher confidence (self-efficacy) about diet but did not change reported behaviors. Qualitative responses showed people pin for motivation and planning, yet often do not turn pins into action.
