- ## Extracts
- "many neurotypical people view ***genuine, literal requests for information*** as an attempt to dodge responsibility, show someone up, or make a social or corporate power grab."
- "Giving them the benefit of the doubt, answering their questions, and teaching them what to do is still the best approach because ***it will negate the problem either way***. The person who genuinely needs help will be helped, and the employee who is trying to slack off will realize their plan isn’t working."
