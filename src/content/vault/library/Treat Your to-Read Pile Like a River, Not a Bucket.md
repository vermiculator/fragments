full-title: "Treat Your to-Read Pile Like a River, Not a Bucket"
summary: Instead of viewing your to-read pile as a bucket to empty, think of it as a river from which you can select a few items at a time. The real problem isn't too much information, but having too many meaningful choices that you can't possibly fit into your schedule. Accept that you can't do it all and focus on what truly matters to you.

- "The real trouble, according to the leading techno-optimist Clay Shirky, wasn't information overload, but ["filter failure"](https://www.cnet.com/news/shirky-problem-is-filter-failure-not-info-overload/). We needed – and we'd eventually get – more sophisticated ways to filter the wheat from the online chaff. And then we'd no longer feel overwhelmed."

- "Others are the familiar problems of Life Under Late Capitalism™, like the feeling that there's simply not enough time in the day to be a good parent while staying afloat financially. What they all have in common is that the things you're choosing between all genuinely matter, and would benefit from more time than you can give them."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k1xe5sxf9r468cpz01pxvkhz)
- "It's about becoming more efficient and organised, or better at prioritising, with the implied promise that you might thereby eliminate or disregard enough of life's unimportant nonsense to make time for the meaningful stuff. T"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k1xe6ad348f2ft7c83cskz37)
- "It's not a question of rearranging your to-do list so as to [make space for all your "big rocks"](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/so/60NWXZixI/c?w=g9EKf5Lv4dlKvqPm06dCQrm_h5m7KtU3D_wcpDzjNds.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcHBsZXNlZWRzLm9yZy9iaWctcm9ja3NfY292ZXkuaHRtIiwiciI6ImEwOGRhOGFkLTlkMTktNGUyYS02OTdhLTE4ODMwZWNhM2JkOCIsIm0iOiJscCJ9), but of accepting that there are simply too many rocks to fit in the jar. You have to take a stab at deciding what matters most, among your various creative passions/life goals/responsibilities – and then do that, while acknowledging that you'll inevitably be neglecting many other things that matter too."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k1xe77k03tkhny8yczk89cnx)
