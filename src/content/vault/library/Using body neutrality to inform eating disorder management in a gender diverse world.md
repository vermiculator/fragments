- "This pilot examines the acceptability and utility of a SSI designed to help adolescents improve functionality appreciation (a component of body neutrality) by focusing on valuing one's body based on the functions it performs, regardless of appearance satisfaction."

- "Transgender youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may experience complex relationships with eating because of cognitive rigidity, including inflexible thoughts and behaviors around food and/or their body. Yet, there is no research that provides guidance to clinicians providing care for youth with the unique triad of gender dysphoria, ASD, and disordered eating. This case series discusses trends in presentation and management of three cases from a multidisciplinary gender care clinic. All three individuals endorsed rigid thoughts around food and/or body appearance, which affected nutritional intake; however, their presenting eating disorder behaviors, described etiology for disordered thoughts, diagnosis, and level of engagement in a multidisciplinary treatment model varied. Based on these cases we hypothesize several strategies including early engagement with ASD specialists, proactive screening and discussions around eating with all transgender youth with suspected/confirmed ASD, continued discussions throughout care, as disordered eating behaviors may change after the initiation of gender-affirming medications, dietician visits early in treatment regardless of endorsed thoughts and behaviors, tailored management to the unique needs of each individual and their eating thoughts/behaviors, and consistent multidisciplinary collaboration."
