title: "Extra-Activism: Counter-Mapping and Data Justice"

Counter-mapping has evolved from the 1970s to now, integrating media campaigns to support Indigenous rights and identity. It highlights the importance of these mapping efforts in challenging colonial practices and promoting social justice.

Geo-spatial instruments have been used since the ﬁfteenth century to highlight potential sites of mineral, oil, and gas extraction, and inscribe European economic, cultural and political control across indigenous territories."
