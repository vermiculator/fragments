- "The assumption is that manufacturers would improve the durability of their products to avoid incurring losses."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5bmx8s42j90mtvn9d30f4)
- "Longer guarantees could also cause rebound effects in consumer behaviour, and by increasing the control of manufacturers over the repair ecosystem, they could negatively affect independent repairers."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5bn1b6mpsv49b4gj0tbx5)
- "the legal guarantee only deals with faults that can in some way be considered as a manufacturing defect. While this can include a product’s insufficient durability (which is far from easy to evaluate given the variation in the way products may be used), it excludes any damage related to mishaps"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbm5bn3g62remqped77rxtea)
