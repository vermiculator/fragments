full-title: "Skateboarding and the City: Skate and Destroy"
short-title: "Skateboarding and the City"
subtitle: "Skate and Destroy"
summary: Skateboarding transforms urban spaces by creatively using them for play and exploration, rather than simply observing them. Skaters see the city differently, finding joy and potential in overlooked areas, which critiques traditional architecture and urban design. Through their actions, skateboarders create a new understanding of the city, making it an interactive and dynamic environment.

- "why mark objects in this way? Certainly architecture contains elements of power, making us obey barriers and routes, informing us that transgressions will be met by hostile response, or simply reminding us of the pervasive presence of public institutions, the state, corporations and urban managers. This is what Lefebvre terms architecture’s ‘phallic formant’, symbolizing masculine force as image and threat.88 In this context, skateboarders’ assault is a small yet significant challenge to power, meeting like with like. Where owners and managers inscribe authority by ‘writing
  on the ground’ with signs, fences and other markers, traces like skateboarding marks and graffiti are forms of counter-inscription; both skateboarding and graffiti, notes Vivoni,
  ‘claim space by drawing lines across the urban

 - proportional impact? one person to one person for example. but you never know that subjective weight

- "skateboarding is far more than urban writing, for it also involves critiques of objects (reinterpreting buildings and spaces), articulation (speaking and not just writing), consumption (consuming without owning), production (producing energies rather than things) and control (opposing urban managers)."
