summary: Crosscut is a new tool that allows users to draw dynamic models using simple visual elements, combining the ease of pen and paper with the interactivity of software. It helps users externalize their thoughts and explore ideas more intuitively without needing to write traditional code. By manipulating graphical representations, Crosscut promotes a hands-on approach to thinking and creating interactive models.

- "We externalize the thinking process. Each externalized thought forms a *model*—a simplified representation that allows us to preserve, communicate, or reflect on the thought."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jr3r7j4g48mk1bf74seajkez)
- "Models aren’t just the end result of the thinking process. Making models can be an integral part of the process of understanding. The act of externalizing, communicating, and reflecting through models changes and advances one’s inner thoughts, surfacing new realizations."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jr3r88cv9hhhkkczp0ejtyhn)
- "Thoughts move quickly, so the tools we use to make our models must be fast to use and readily available."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jr3r8m311wzfn7rmf1m1rv6g)
- "When it’s frictionless to externalize your thoughts, you can create many small variations and reflect on the consequences of each change."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jr3r90mbzdnj1b325h1a5f5k)

- "You should never be locked out of your model because you mistyped something or made an erroneous connection. The model should remain alive and usable"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jr3rrsk9dr4cpmxkszq9aa2m)
