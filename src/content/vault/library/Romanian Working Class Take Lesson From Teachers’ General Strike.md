## Extracts
- "Romanian public [supported the strike](https://www.romaniajournal.ro/society-people/survey-three-quarters-of-romanians-support-the-teachers-strike/), with many blaming the strike on the handling of the government. [International solidarity](https://twitter.com/NEUnion/status/1666454871590019076) was forthcoming from education unions in other countries as well"  ^b6b369
- "The lack of a political expression for the mounting discontent of the working class, which is ever piling up under the domestic and worldwide economic crises, coupled with example of large strike waves in [[Britain]], and above all in [[France]], have all served to push workers in [[Romania]] towards increasing militancy on the industrial front" #militancy #strikes #class-struggle #workers 
- "granted the 25 percent pay rise to teaching staff, but not to the 80,000 auxiliary and non-teaching staff that accompanied them" #pay 
- "forming new, radical, militant unions. But this would be a mistake, as it would separate the most radical layers of workers from the mass of the workers, just as the working class is beginning to move." #mass-movements #protest-methods #organising
- "Instead, we must pose the need for a fighting leadership, and clear out all those bureaucratic elements that lack confidence in the power of the workers."  #bureaucracy #class-struggle
