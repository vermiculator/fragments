## Notes

- stock photos really very rarely improve the experience of the web
- good uses eg educational resource and communication support
- bad use - pollution of brand/organisation websites/blog content
- when is stock footage useful, when is it irritating
- saturation of focus-grabbing side-by-side footage eg 'subway surfers' and minecraft gameplay is popular
  - 'it helps with my adhd!' achievable with tools, or better tools needed. embedding within content muddies it further and bakes in extraneous info.
    - a less-often-occurring phenomeneon of 'accessible for you is worse for everyone else' - i must make it emphatically clear that almost always accessiblity measures have either a neutral or positive effect for those who didn't expect to benefit from it - but this would be a good 'exception that proves the rule' candidate
- stock images/footage in ads, even worse.
- increasing variety through uptake of AI generated image - this doesn't improve the experience of stock content but just makes it harder to spot - it is useful for the same use cases where stock content is already genuinely useful, and just as annoying in other contexts eg ads, and brings all the extra ethical issues of AI
