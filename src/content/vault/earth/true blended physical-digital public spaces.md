ways to have 'ghost' presence in physical, tangible presence of the digital, and to replicate the realtime in a privacy conscious manner in the digital format 
	- so you don't have to learn two ways of doing things for physical and virtual, it is all the same mechanism with different access methods - no forcing phone call or online or in person, all allowed
	- eg meetings, classrooms and appointments using transparent screens - physical receptionists occupied by virtual visitors
	- eg GP surgery quick-modelled/generated from a few angles, even continuously from fixed cameras, so that a virtual visit is merged into a real-life one.
	- could be really useful for people who know a set way of doing things but can no longer attend in person, or for easier errands etc. 
	- Ideas for an aging population - could expand to many service sectors
