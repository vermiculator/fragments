- "social technology" for accompanying social goals
- eg church, marriage, fashion, holidays, borders, games, sports
- reframing: 'social construct' often used to mean something kinda arbitrary, but many of these constructs are useful tools to accomplish something or other - it's our own choice which tools we use and how we use them
- changing behaviours through the technologies
- many people living without the understanding that culture is malleable
