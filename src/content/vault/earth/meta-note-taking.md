- Note-taking for various purposes and how an individual's tool use changes, getting it all out, structured entities etc
- potentials:
    - AR notetaking
    - geographically situated notetaking
    - tangible digital notetaking
- On 'atomic' notes in pkm and how I struggle due to the sortal nature of a 'note', or when I define them as 'concepts' or 'ideas' how much do I want to split them up. I don't note for knowledge chunks so much as 'idea' chunks so atomicity is tricky.
		- noting by level of confidence in a statement?
- I'm growing past the digital garden metaphor as I agree with various others who've mused on the subject that the messy connective way we write notes is more akin to an ecosystem, where notes rely on and strengthen each other in a haphazard fashion rather than being grown to fit one format
- I've also found that it hasn't been practically useful for me - whilst some notes are more developed than others they don't necessarily trend towards 'complete' - evergreen notes as per Andy matuschak's definition is of interest but I'm still torn as what counts as atomic, which notes in using more as categorizers, which notes are fully developed but not of overall use to me, etc etc. the linear model of progression doesn't fit me
- I also find that most entities here are either seeds or soil to cue my own memory, organise sources and retrieve bookmarks -- the links between notes are often more crucial than the content because this whole space is as much a tool as a publication
