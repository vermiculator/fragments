title: conductive silicone
---

- anemone sensor silicone circuit - designed for potential uses in underwater or natural environments to sense the presence/movement of small animals
- remixed from another stroke sensor built with conductive textile threads
- instructions focus on the form factor and composition of a successful sensor using silicone, so display only a simple output and ad-hoc circuit as proof-of-concept
- part of a larger exploration into the use of conductive silicone
- take advantage of the material properties of silicone.
- authored by - interested professionally in 'digital naturalism', a prolific contributor to online maker communities and runs an on-site maker lab in the jungle
- I tried this project for remix assignment, used graphite powder over carbon fibre and struggled with correct mixture ratios for enough conductivity
- hated the gloop of working with silicone but saw the potential of flexible moulded sensors, soft circuitry, elements for puppetry etc

### material properties of silicone
- waterproofing, suitable for underwater application, no corroding wires
- likely unsuitable for other extreme weather conditions such as heat or wind damage, but physically somewhat reliable as can still work under duress or damage
- salt/pH level/other chemical compositions of containing liquids?
- firm and flexible without being brittle, can snap back into moulded shape
- stretch and bend 
- can cast very thin or very thick 
- skin-like, relatively natural human feel 
- combines well with both hard and soft elements, could be good connector/inbetween
- can 3D print precise moulds, or make moulds from waste materials

## silicone in computing
- Silicone revolutionised computing as metal fibres can only be a certain thinness, silicone melted into tiny strands makes chips
- Silicone is a semi-conductor so it is used for transistors

## silicone chemistry
- Pure silicon is a semi-conductor, the outer electrons are tied up in the covalent bond - small amounts of energy can free them from the lattice [(Source)](https://vrchemistry.chem.ox.ac.uk/periodic_table/page44.htm#:~:text=Silicon%20and%20germanium%20are%20the,bonds%20of%20the%20diamondlike%20framework.)
- "At low voltages they are insulators, but they begin to conduct electricity if the applied voltage is high enough." [(Source)](https://vrchemistry.chem.ox.ac.uk/periodic_table/page44.htm#:~:text=Silicon%20and%20germanium%20are%20the,bonds%20of%20the%20diamondlike%20framework.)
