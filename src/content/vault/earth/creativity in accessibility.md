title: creativity in accessibility
---

- is there room for creativity in access, does it depend on the importance of the information communicated, as in with info/warning for general purpose in other media
- meaning and expression in media
- dynamic subtitles
- ive seen inadequate audio commentary and jokes in subtitles that hamper the accessibility 
- but also room for FUN in life, especially for disabled people writing for disabled people
- interpretation is also a social activity, has all the same interpersonal considerations as other forms of communication

- found a project that plays with this https://laurelschwulst.com/e/alt-text-as-poetry/

- when my dad reads out subtitles from TV for my mum (eye problems), he sometimes censors ([[disabled people are often infantilised#^458322|disabled people can swear]]) and sometimes adds in lines, re-edits for clarity ([[what should we interpret?]]) but also makes changes in pursuit of puns, wordplay and humour. I find this interesting and don't know where i stand, if I'm there I'll also give her the uninterpreted version (although obviously its already through a translated filter) so she gets both the information and the playful experience.

- to look for research or more creative explorations in this vein!
