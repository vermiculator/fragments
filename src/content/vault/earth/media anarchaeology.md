media archaeology with an "intention to disrupt prevailing progressivist orthodoxy of media studies by allowing more anarchic and transversal exploration of different territories of media technological developments across time and space."
- "Zielinski describes this ambition in terms of setting forth a “new cartography for media anarchaeology” (2006, p.261). Zielinski’s (an)archaeological cartography aspires to contest the idea of a linear progression towards always a more perfected media technological actuality. Such an approach does not only complicate the old/new, analog/digital polarities but also disrupts the dominance of certain media centres"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0pwsah5akkfmkf9g14ytc26)
- "As Zielinski argues, a constructive disruption is possible by the means of “establishing effective connections with the peripheries”yet without attempting to integrate these into the centres. This might eventually lead to help “maintain the worlds of media in a state that is open and transformable” (ibid., p.261)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0pwv1cjvmx69kq4f3vcrkw7)
