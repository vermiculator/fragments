title: reorientation as method
---

on naturalisation/denaturalisation
'think outside the box' (that phrase always annoyed me because it actually constructed a box i didn't know was there before and could now only think within)
on 'mixing it up' and changing the view and 'change of scenery' and going for a walk to 'clear your head' or 'clear the air' or move time and space onwards to uncover newness

---

on how i personally reorient myself to gather new ideas, when stuck i move position and see a room from somewhere else, physically reorienting can brain-reorient

---

i've only ever been described as so 'creative' or seen to have 'novel' reactions or ideas because i've always been inclined to reorient

also for me a neurodivergent paradigm - just thinking on [[positionality]] - its the comfort of familiarity and the necessity/inevitability of change that has me iterating with adjustment as an inherent way of moving in the world - it holds both familiarity and strangeness, the tensions of which sustain me (and likely anybody, but likely particularly many neurodivergent people and particularly particularly me)

its also why slight-sci-fi, near futures, low fantasy, etc are appealing to me - slight reorientations, slightly different lenses, slightly different perspectives

---

slight reorientation is the closest i have to a consistent artistic practise
