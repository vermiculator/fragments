## Mentions
-  "This practice of professional sorting and cataloging is **explicitly meant for the larger community—curation for the public**. Museum and library collections may be privately owned, but are a part of the general [[public property|commons]]; they are resources for a collective." - [[library/Public Curation and Private Collection The Production of Knowledge on Pinterest.Com|(Lui, 2015)]]
- "Curation therefore encompasses practices of sorting, classifying, and labeling for the purposes of organization and **display**"  - [[library/Public Curation and Private Collection The Production of Knowledge on Pinterest.Com|(Lui, 2015)]]
- "If knowledge is understood to be the resource that these institutions provide then, as Hooper-Greenhill (1992) contends, the role of the curator is to **shape that knowledge for the general public**, through the creation of accessible object categories"  - any group curation needs to be interfaceable?? - [[library/Public Curation and Private Collection The Production of Knowledge on Pinterest.Com|(Lui, 2015)]]
