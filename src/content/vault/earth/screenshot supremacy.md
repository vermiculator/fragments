screenshots are a common method of content collection due to:
- ease, few actions required
- comparable methods across devices (usually a single click or physical button)
- compatibility of tools across applications
- portability of image data types
- human readability of data
- [[refinding is quicker from images than text]]
but:
- image-only screenshots in circulation have often lost important metadata
- manipulated screenshots, unfaithful reproduction
- [[screenshots can contain extra context|lost context]]
- establishing a new form of data rather than a continuation
- separate instances remain unlinked
- even 'search by image' isn't particularly effective
