## Notes 
- Goals are vague, boundaries between public and private are blurred, social media by rule of corporation doesn't facilitate genuine relationships.
- so many use cases for social media, and no one ecosystem focuses on any - generalised social platform rather than intentional tool
- social contact can be facilitated in ways that benefit communities large and small, with no attention-capture metric for success designed for addiction.
- fediverse, other federated systems, using ActivityPub or similar, eg Mastodon, Bonfire
- the rise and fall of twitter, the timing of release of threads
- Intent based social media
	- social media based on the intention of your content: eg to explain/educate, to share ideas, to empathise/share experience, to entertain, to ask for help/advice/support, to share something fun/cute/nice, to give support, to rant, to critique, to promote/compliment, to broadcast knowledge, to organise, thirst trap type stuff, boost other people's content, add to others points
	  - Eg Here's an experience, I'm looking for a dialogue
		  - Here's a question, I'm looking for an answer
		  - Here's a scenario, I'm looking for comfort
		  - Here's a scenario, I'm looking for advice 
		  - Here's entertainment, please play along
- Thinking about more deliberate social media, what ppl connect for.
- No fixed boundary to what people will and want to use it for. It is a medium and a tool and ever-changing
