## traditional methods

- task-based testing: users completing specific actions
- think-aloud: verbal feedback during interaction
- A/B testing: comparing design variants
- analytics and metrics: quantitative usage data
	- efficiency of task completion
	- effectiveness, success rate, error rate
	- satisfaction

## wider considerations - testing for equity

- [[accessibility]] testing
- cultural context, global differences
- digital literacy, varying technical skill levels
- multi-lingual, multi-device
