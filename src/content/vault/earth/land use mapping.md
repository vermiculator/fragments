* difficult to even find what's publicly/privately owned
*  let alone direct ownership or type of usage
* have to pay for individual records so its supposedly public knowledge but not actually accessible in reality
* presumably orgs can requisition more info for eg ecological purpose but how does this process goes
* right to roam, public rights of ways, common laws
* who on earth has actual access to land registries
* more open access and everyday stakeholder involvement in common protocols across existing decentralised local govs on land use and planning ?
