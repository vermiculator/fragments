- [[Keep your inbox empty|Not your email inbox]]-- I mean your non-urgent 'to dos', your project ideas, your RSS feeds, newsletters, unread articles and bookmarks.
- Thinking of each entry not as a requirement, a demand for your time and energy, but as a possibility, an optional next step, or an opportunity.
- what's the fear - being left with unanswered questions and unexplored paths? I for one want to die with things left to do, it is inherent to life
- So choosing to keep a full inbox means you never actually need to empty it
- It's been useful to see my many saved resources as a world of possibility and not a checklist to systematically crunch through
- Came to this first through thinking about 'demand avoidance' or 'desire for autonomy' in the PDA ([autism](autism.md)) profile 
- On considering different scopes and scales of 'demand' and how to lessen the effect of real and perceived demands that cause me distress, I found this area of 'inspiration hoarding' to be one that I could easily reframe.
- Was reminded of the subject by  ['how real people process notes'](https://youtu.be/6Bbj7xYj3Bc)
- It's probably a different case if physical books are taking up your space or cluttering your vision.
	- I limit this by using libraries and passing on finished books.
	- Physical notes and other 'inspiring' objects can often be photographed or digitised, but this doesn't always trigger what it does to hold an object.
	- Dependant on space, many have resource hoards hidden from everyday view.
	- Many find it more inspiring to be surrounded by their inspiring objects
	- A good case for separation of spaces for synthesising/creating/working/thinking and for relaxing/living/healing/sleeping to place the psychological burden of objects in a different space and time
	- Inspiration comes from literally everywhere and your everyday spaces can become the object of creative burden - not always a clear cut separation
