- wiki redlink - the absent link, the lacuna, just as important [[Ted Nelson on hypertext]] and [[All Together Now Collective Knowledge, Collective Narratives, and Architectures of Participation|(Rettburg, 2005)]]
- highlighting that which is absent
- linkages we don't yet see, information we don't yet have
		- adjacent stuff may be relevant
			- others' [[annotations and marginalia]] can be useful
			- "Locating Digitised Marginalia"
- seeds for future work
- see in [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture|(Smolicki, 2017)]], 'what we might say'
