## Mentions

- "today sousveillance is an intrinsic element of everyday media-technological landscape and strategies of tech-corporations benefiting from the content from sousveillance practices" [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^b75b81|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
- "the tactical, disobedient and empowering quality of sousveillance was enabled precisely by the independence from the mechanisms of the dominant frameworks"  [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^0812f9|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
- "the practice of sousveillance might now be said to have irreversibly saturated the everyday life of societies, at least those with a high degree of technological pervasiveness."  [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^1a6c66|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
- "\[life-logging services] can be seen as modes of such a commodified sousveillance, in which the subversive and disobedient qualities are significantly tamed."  [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^d87298|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
	- (see for instance Sonvilla-Weiss, 2008)" [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^de5b48|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
- "arguably, sousveillance has originally been conceived as a practice aiming to make oneself visible to the surveilling gaze of the system, but on one’s own terms and from the perspective of a singular position"  [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^91efe3|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
- "reflectionism (ibid., p.333), a tactical use of technology to confront authorities, purposefully recording their actions (and misconduct) to reveal their mechanics, motivations, or violence, and, in so doing, to balance the distribution of power. In this reading of sousveillance, technologies are incorporated into one’s existence to counteract the their hegemonic use by authorities who aim to control and discipline the society. On the other hand, however, he approached sousveillance as a practice incorporating recording devices into life as existential technologies, techniques of “self-determination and mastery over our own destiny” (Mann, 2003)."
