## Mentions
- "an article on early filing cabinets written by John Tagg. Tagg’s description of these fixtures as instruments of power, privilege, and control (2011) \[...] portrayed the cabinet as \[...] a predecessor of what we now call a digital database. \[...] I asked myself whether, superseded by the ubiquitous cloud, a bulky, wooden and disconnected cabinet such as this one was not, paradoxically, the safest, most stable, and reliable technology for organizing memory today? A space for regaining autonomy and control over a vulnerable digital legacy in capture culture?"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6avrjpfvg1tb5rwbbq5e8r7)
