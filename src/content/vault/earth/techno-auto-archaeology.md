mixing [[autoethnography]] and [[media archaeology]] in a technological context

autoethnography + media archaeology -> autoarchaeology or archaethnography, both terms have been considered in literatures

me looking for a term to describe what it is I'm doing in looking back over my information and technology practises and this is incredibly wordy and unconcise but it wraps up all the practises I wanted to credit for this method
