title: all mammals, all birds and at least some others

- theories of consciousness are frequently updating to include more kinds of creatures
- it is scientific consensus (source needed) that at least all mammals, all birds and at least some other kinds of creatures (such as octopuses) do have consciousness.
- [[science is all theories|check up on science, it's always updating]] and there is a high likelihood given human experience/[[folk psychology]]/philosophy/other [[frameworks of understanding]]/etc that all creatures including invertebrates are indeed equally sentient/sapient/conscious/soulful
- markers of supposed difference that are repeatedly broken down - "language, tool use, social behaviour, mental events" [[Simians, Cyborgs and Women - The Reinvention of Nature#^ac7963|➡]]
