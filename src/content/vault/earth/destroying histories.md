title: destroying histories
---

Oppressing classes, regimes and political groups often destroy the physical evidence of peoples, practises and beliefs they want to erase. This can at worst lead to loss of an entire line of people, or an entire culture. It also often sets back fights for liberation and justice, innovations in science and technology, and other developing practises, by destroying hard-fought knowledge that must later be re-discovered.
