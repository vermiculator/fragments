screenshots can be more valuable with more added metadata in order to recreate the entire context of the screenshot. this could provide much more seamless revisits of place and process - people often 'save' the entire context through simply leaving browser tabs 'open' - mental clutter, volatile and heavy on processing, but traditional bookmarks don't save enough of the context/arrangement of multiple sites or applications/specific semantics of the task at hand, or internal program 'steps' required by monolithic web apps
