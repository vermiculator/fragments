- fat positivity movements -> body positivity movements -> body neutrality
- respect and care for the body regardless of size, aesthetics, beauty standards
- further to this, striving for good health at all sizes
- but without over-focus on any one standard of acceptable health, for the benefit of those with disabilities and chronic conditions
- neutral, factual language around bodies, respectful treatment
- this is more normalised in some cultures than others prior to the current wave but the language on bodies in popular culture, media, internet etc that I've been exposed to is still overwhelmingly US-centric especially on these matters/beauty standards etc
