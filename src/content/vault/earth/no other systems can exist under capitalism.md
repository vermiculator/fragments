A common quick-and-dirty argument to any anti-capitalist thought is that with its 'freedoms' any other system is 'free' to exist within it. This is not true, whilst the opposite is. [(1)](Beyond Money#^711145)


- ## Notes
- micro and macro societies - small capitalist societies can exist under socialism and small socialist societies can exist under capitalism but capitalism consumes the small socialist systems within it and destroys them entirely, whereas the activities of the capitalists can continue under large socialism, just without the wealth disparities and exploitation.
