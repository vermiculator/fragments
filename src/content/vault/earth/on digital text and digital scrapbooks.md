- on living documents etc, [[quickref#^86a1c2]] and [[quickref#^e9778d]], reexplore and combine for insights on features
	- 'constructive' hypertext as living documents
	-  understanding the participatory nature of constructive hypertext
	- linear collaborative works as confrontation - because of linearity and the power being held only by the last author, rather than plural paths - interesting as applied to Tumblr as it is both linear and plural
	- 1993-1996 Hypertext Hotel "the hotel offered a spatial metaphor for a collaborative writing event" - collaborative worldbuilding as the most pluralistic web-writing practise. eg SCP Foundation
	- living documents as 'a writing event, anarchistic in nature'
	- [[works/thesis/thesis-discussion]] - CONSIDER THIS can only be collective to the degree of agency the authors have - "Collective narratives are collective to varying degrees, dependent upon the distribution of agency both to distributed authors and to aspects of the system itself."
