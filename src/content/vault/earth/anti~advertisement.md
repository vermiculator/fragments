### Notes
- advertising and marketing in the digital age
- this is not any expertise of mine from the advertisers angle but as a consumer I have ben poisoned and polluted by its oversaturation
- it's in our ears, it's in our eyes, it's mid-song, mid-show, mid-video
     - podcast/music streaming ads having better audio quality than the content you're trying to listen to 
- fast-moving high-budget attention-grabbing controversy-stirring marketing culture
- let's ban billboards
- things that are well-advertised but bad for humanity vs poorly-advertised but genuinely helpful
- often ads are genuine displays of craftsmanship and creativity, this could be put to better use (sharing the message or telling the story that the creatives are self-compelled to show rather than in service of an arbitrary company/product/service)
- too often they are also not that. innovation for the sake of rebranding something that has outlived its usefulness? or innovating towards something better
- notable exceptions eg clear PSAs useful, trailing other media content is often exciting, notice of events and other time-sensitive things often of genuine use and interest
- plenty of sources of curated collections of ideas/products/services that are actually consensual and sought out rather than shoved down your throat whilst trying to enjoy other aspects of life
- [[connecting ideas]] is totally different in the age of hyper-connectivity, cold-calling less of the norm
- there may be something you 'didn't know you needed' but that is a lot rarer than advertisers claim and often solved by melting-pot style curation eg 'discover' and 'explore' tabs online, charity shop and car boot in real life, booth-style conventions and networking events in real life. These all benefit from generalised targeting without too direct of an intrusion
- direct mail still appears to be useful to older audiences. I can't really see this being repopularised with younger audiences and digital natives though
- shift away from pervasive blanket marketing to pervasive personal marketing
- rise of sponsored content
- some people genuinely find targeted advertising useful
- others would like targeted adverts only with stringent controls of who sees what data but can't fathom a way in which this could be seamless
- it would almost certainly be possible to give advertisers the info on our interests without sacrificing all privacy if this was only more directly integrated into our interactions with whatever we consider 'products' or 'interests' or 'services' online
- with special attention paid to ease and usability
- 
- [[France]] seems to have a culture of anti-advertisement more than anywhere else, a history of resistance particularly in [[Paris]]
