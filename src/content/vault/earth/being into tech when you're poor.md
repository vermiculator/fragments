* other people can afford to upgrade tech and buy new things to experiment with
* yes its possible to be innovative with old tech or low tech but this is one arbitrary constraint where your style might be better suited to high budget options
* and v annoying where you need the functionality of niche tech to actually make life simpler, less tech cruft, etc, accessibility tech etc, and then these niche products are more expensive/proprietary/hard to fix
* more ingenuity needed to fit your life into smaller storage space and lower computational power
* once again the mental load of being poor, the logistics
