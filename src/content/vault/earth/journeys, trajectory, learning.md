## Notes
- learning as journey, as trajectory
- life, purpose, career, direction as journey, as trajectory
- how to connect separate thinkers' knowledge graphs - how to reference notes from others' knowledge graphs - how to traverse through a knowledge graph with your path stored
- tabbed/side-by-side options on eg obsidian and similar
- peripheral notes
- knowledge built on other knowledge, exploring a research space, with or without destination and goal, growth or interlinking or bolstering a side
- research goals and research methods, the scientific process
- if they are trajectories can we use vector maths instrumentally
