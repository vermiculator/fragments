invention/innovation is a daily practise for many disabled people
- altering tools, building our own
- adjusting environments
- adjusting methods, plans, processes

 where our needs are specific or just generally environments/communications/resources are inaccessible, we find our own way to make it work (often left to us/our carers/loved ones rather than catered for/previously considered)
