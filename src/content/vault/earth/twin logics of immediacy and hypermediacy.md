- fixation on erasing mediation but its actually hypermediation
- appropriating the qualities of the previous media. In advertisement it empasises its improvement 
- multimedia, windows of mediums in mediums, vs 'immersive real-time'
- they're essentially the same as we can never have an actually raw experience, always medjated mediated through the body
- interactive hypertextual apps grouped as hypermedia - random access combination of text, motion, img etc
- A “combination of random access with multiple media \[...] brought together in any combination. It is a medium that offers ‘random access’; it has no physical beginning, middle, or end” (Cotton & Oliver 1993)
- [[Ted Nelson on hypertext]]
- having a phone is a media experience, combi social media etc
- splintered, fragmentary experience 
- 'explore' pc media but that's not necessarily true, I find older people fear the device and don't click around
- living now often in several levels of mediation
- close reading and distant reading, deep engagement 
- seeking refuge in chronology 
- desktop metaphor
- even traditional photographic image is mediated through chemical process, and now digital [[mediation]]
- in which ways are physical and digital mediation different? Can we imagine new forms of physical mediation? Is this any more desirable than digital mediation?
- immediacy and authenticity , paint obscuring strokes 
- atomic or distinguishable whole 
- [[immediacy]] as illusion of non-illusion
- obsession with the 'real' world, the most natural and raw
- [[remediation]] is not chronological but it is genealogical - related by contexts and times but not progressive
- partly [[obscured medium]], acknowledge the medium for a different experience.
- use the canvas to show you do exist as an artist - touch of the artist - ai now falsifies this though - cannibalistic media doesn't necessarily deny its authorship and remove the the human element 
- maintaining an illusion, fabricated experience 
- the medium's purpose is to disappear 
- immediacy - delays pull you further from connecting - but not necessarily true for all communications and situations in reality, some delays are real -- j guess ita out of place delays and gaps
