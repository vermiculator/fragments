From [The National Autistic Society](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/identity/autism-and-neurodiversity) (UK based charity):

"The neurodiversity paradigm is a set of ideas based on the principles that: 

- every person should be valued and respected
- no brain (or mind) is more ‘normal’ than any other
- \[...]
- neurodiversity is a natural form of human diversity

The shift is away from seeing neurodivergence \[...] (as a ‘disorder’), to a neutral view of neurodivergence as a difference \[...]. This approach to autism and neurodivergence is very different to the traditional approach of medical science, known as the ‘medical model’."
