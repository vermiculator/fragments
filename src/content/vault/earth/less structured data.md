### Notes
- TODO
- how a connected collection of markdown files is standard in latest wave of notetaking systems compared to previous 'notebook' systems
- notion as current 'gateway' pkm tool, but if restricted by the database, users move elsewhere
- emulating the increasing use of noSQL databases, it's moving away from relational connections
- obv applicable reasons for either in context - structured data best for x y z
- but general trend is towards looser structures as relational can be restrictive
- due to increasing ability to manage unstructured data / use of flexible frameworks and protocols for interfacing
