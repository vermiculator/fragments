## misc seeds
- media nostalgia
- mass vs niche interest
- impact of class
- It's hard to document the lessons you've learned from video/tv/film/creative media eg with ordinary note-taking it could be too lore-context-specific, or requires knowledge of characters, morals not always clear and easy to summarise, often it relies on the abstract feelings and moods created to be impactful, you have to try and trigger a specific multi-sensory type of memory, and it depends on the environment you watched it in
	- could utilise tools eg AI summarising or Readwise suggested highlights
	- visual reference often important
	- themes discussed in literature and media studies, author intention and reader's meanings
	- other people's summaries, book reviews, comprehensive breakdowns, general involvement in fan discourse/fandom/forums
	- https://freebooksforpeople.neocities.org/iwatchmovies
	- use of eg gifs, compilations, animatics etc of scenes and themes as shared frequently on eg tumblr and other fandom heavy sites - distinction between these and memes, and they act as a snapshot of the original media, to support or reflect or springboard off of the original intention rather than actively subvert as many memes do. sometimes somewhere inbetween,  springboarding off of it in headcannon style, with varying depths of alternative choices or additional original lore
	- can be a sort of video moodboard
	- tvtropes actually very useful for this
- gender dissonance in fan culture, Winnicott 'playing and reality', fandoms as transitional objects
- We went very quickly from content wilderness to content oversaturation
- Where did jingles go and why are they coming back
- to be so unsure of the life and stability of your comfort media, things you can rewatch so long as the physical dvd is protected or so long as a streaming company retains the rights, or only having access to it this one time in the moment, how livestream vods are such a different experiences to Livestreams, temporality, experiencing things as a collective, unnus annus fomo.
- different ways that celebrities maybe did weird stunts for PR coverup of bad search terms
- on less land/property ownership for younger generations, the temporal nature of our physical lives and lack of freedom/autonomy/permission to adjust our environments, will we see less Home-Studio huge art installations like La Demure de Chaos ? For the classes who don't own their space, art has to be pack up and go - how does this relate to wearable forms of artistic expression and decoration and travelling cultures, and this relates to eg sailors with their art literally on them and waterproof in tattoo form
-  sci-fi historically always playing on nascent fears
	- but now there are some interesting modern examples, always coming eg black mirror joan is awful and doctor who ep with ai/deepfake vibes great blue yonder
- bigoted scifi fans who consume left-leaning scifi media are misinterpreting - perceiving themselves as the plucky underdog revolutionary against the Big Bads of Social Justice - cognitive dissonance 
- "American Idol didn't invent the reality TV show genre, democratic talent competitions, or the aesthetic requirements of early aughts stardom, but it became a landmark example of all three." - https://youtu.be/TA2dziZ40g0?si=emUT23m1lTnsKBiW Defunctland: The American Idol Theme Park Experience 
- there are multiple types of montage 
- Do they print news on loo roll
- history and practice of jesters, clowning, carnival 
- are celeb gameshows just money laundering into charities? 
- TV shows primarily built for viewing in perfect conditions aka not the real world so everything is too dark and we can't see it. Blue light eg in LoTR solves this!
- ironic media consumption
	* describe liking something 'ironically' as it having genuine appeal to you but the things you like about it are things you don't think were deliberate -- seeded by video on AI doc
	* but I also have this sort of 'charming but they didn't mean it to be' feeling about much of Star Trek TOS but wouldn't consider it 'ironic' viewing
	* relates to cringe culture and being earnest
	* I earnestly enjoy Star Trek TOS but with awareness of the limitations, is this all 'guilty' pleasures are?
* bossa nova, Brazilian popular music that evolved in the late 1950s from a union of samba (a Brazilian dance and music) and cool jazz. The music is in syncopated 2/4 time.
