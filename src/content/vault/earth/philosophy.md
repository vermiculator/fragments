## Seeds
- Michael jubien, we are all ontological parasites like holes (only exist within/due to something else)
- 'we are not composed/contained of matter, we are hosted by matter'
- desire, rationality, etc
	- ‘Impossibility is no constraint on desire’- homo babies
	- Herbert Simon's 'bounded rationality'- an individual's rationality in decision-making is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their brain, and the finite amount of time available
