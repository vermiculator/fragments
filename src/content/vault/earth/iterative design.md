- drawing insights straight from testing
- Adaptive Processes vs Predictive Processes
- design your way out of problems so it doesn't grow and cripple the project
- a process informing itself
- traditionally in agile methodologies the features produced in the next were justified by their lack/need/request in the last
- only build what is needed/wanted right now, that's why it is 'lean'
