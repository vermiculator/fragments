## Mentions
- "In this last decade of the twentieth century, we are in an unusual position to appreciate remediation, because of the rapid development of new digital media and the nearly as rapid response by traditional media. Older electronic and print media are seeking to reaffirm their status within our culture as digital media challenge that status. Both new and old media are invoking the [[twin logics of immediacy and hypermediacy]] in their efforts to remake themselves and each other.” (Bolter & Grusin, 2000, pp4)
