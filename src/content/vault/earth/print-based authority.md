title: print-based authority
---

- denial of legitimacy of [[oral history]] by colonial forces
- print culture underpinning scholarly authority
- indigenous methods of knowing, sharing, etc
- a fixed, static form
- knowledge singularly authored
- recognition by institutions dependent on a lot of culturally specific ways of being
- access to texts and databases and resources
- a scholar as someone who interprets the world for others
- in extracting certain information there is already so much removed, and in printing in text it is further decontextualised
- narratives are messy in reality, representing complexity in 'legible' form requires constant reflection in who it is legible for and what it means to untangle it in this way
