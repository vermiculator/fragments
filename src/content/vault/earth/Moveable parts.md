Have downsides due to more ways to break, vulnerability to wear and tear and vibration etc

But benefit of physicalities too, in that there is no obfuscated function, it is self documenting, it is modular, repairable, sustainable, etc 

Just need surrounding social infrastructure to allow maintenance and repair
