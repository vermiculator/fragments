## Note 
- not focusing here on other reasons, such as:
	- destruction of books by the author for personal or political reasons
	- burning copies of sacred texts as ritual
	- burning of personal ephemera such as private letters
		- although 'Burn' from the musical Hamilton provides commentary on how this can amount to the same thing if done by those who know their position in history in their lifetime
	- accompanying cremation (by choice of the deceased or their family)
