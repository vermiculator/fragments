- can you define [[politics]]? 
- using technology to achieve political goals or to stabilise political orders ^8709eb
- technical infrastructure as forms of order eg
	- NY low bridges prevent buses reaching beach destinations. Robert Moses
		- what happens when these exclusionary structures become beloved, part of place - relates to [[colonialist architecture]]/21st century backlash against visual/cultural evidence of colonial legacies
- [[spatial design]]/histories of architectures and city planning have both implicit and explicit political purpose [[spatial design is political]]
- [[anti-protest measures]]
- some technology is more explicitly compatible with different political systems eg solar or nuclear, [[tech for war]] and [[tech for good]]
- digital technologies, [[internet sociology]], data inequities, etc
