## The Concept 
Legacy systems store gender in binary terms. [[gender diversity|Gender]] is not, and never has been, restricted to 'M/F'.
		
## Notes
- M/F/Prefer not to say
	- still inadequate and oppressive, assumes gender variance is reticence to 'reveal' some 'true' gender
- M/F/Other/Prefer not to say
	- just about adequate
	- But if you ACTUALLY need gender data (hint: [[You nearly-never need to know a user's gender, actually|you probably don't]]), why would you arbitrarily limit the precision of data
			- Especially on so-called 'diversity monitoring' forms
			- If 'Other' is used, strong suggestion of multi-selection and self-description

## Mentions
-  "defining the gender category with a binary value has already introduced bias into the system." [[How AI Image Generators Make Bias Worse|➡]]
