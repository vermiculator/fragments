a technique for remembering/capturing memory/retrieving memory/storing memory will often (inevitably?) be later co-opted into a technology that takes over this role

eg writing took over from brain-techniques and digital methods took over writing
it isn't to say the techniques must entirely die out, just that the technology supersedes the necessity of the technique
