Self-described relations restricted by data options or available interfacing methods. An instance of [[data so imprecise that it is inaccurate]] and [[digitising the analogue means data loss|losing data through analogue-to-digital conversion]] 

### Notes
- social media reframing social relations within select categories
- early on, as 'friend' and 'follower' 
- then more extensively through eg fb familial relations and relationship statuses
- to later eg snapchat/bereal/etc with close friend groups and streak partners
- more generally with parasocial relationships now incredibly common
- will machine learning soon by used to define relationships?
	- it is likely already used in eg determining human networks for marketing, surveillance, etc
	- life simulation games that generate relationships on the basis of interactions
		- eg The Sims 4 appears to have a complex relationship system, will check the code/docs
