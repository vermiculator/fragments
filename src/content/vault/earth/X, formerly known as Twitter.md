- pretty much wholesale rejection of the name change of the company is a [[heart-warming small acts of solidarity|heart-warming small act of solidarity]]
- I've seen references on both traditional and social media switched to 'formerly known as Twitter'
- a lot of old site/blog templates etc that build in Twitter integration with hard-coded names and logos, you can see clearly now how recently infrastructures or content has been updated on a lot of legacy sites
- potential for wider problems with text searching and [[SEO as an industry|SEO]] and other methods of [[connecting ideas|discoverability]] when considering usability 
    - I've arbitrarily linked instances of the single letter X here to illustrate the problem ^ef207a
    - any phrase 'X is Y', logical arguments, arithmetic or algebra in plaintext/not code-escaped becomes an issue 
    - especially bad for legacy systems with with inadequate text management 
    - disambiguating a single letter word from a single letter (as with 'I')
    - company and brand names generally longer than a single character for trademark etc
    - letter x sometimes used as plaintext 'exit' button
    - may be used as a special character in other ways, or worse for screenreaders?
