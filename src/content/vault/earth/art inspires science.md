Ideas for innovation can come from anywhere. Those with creative inclinations will inject naïve or hobbyist designs instead into creative works, either untested or with expertise from consultants. Sometimes these ideas are cross-pollinated back into the scientific field if they are somewhat feasible and provide a new angle for experimentation. Those that don't or can't make the leap provide value, perspective and inspiration regardless.
