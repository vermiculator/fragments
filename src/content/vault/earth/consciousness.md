## Misc
- 17th century scholars dissecting live dogs as believed it no different to opening up a machine - somewhat still pervading perception of non-human animals akin to robots, without consciousness
- even if that were true (which both science and philosophy generally holds now that almost all kinds of creatures do have at least sapience and likely sentience - [[all mammals, all birds and at least some others]]) - we didn't manufacture and program it, do we have the right to tinker with it - similar to the question of which level of medicine is reasonable, which level of animal ecosystem intervention is reasonable, fair, etc
- not just knee jerk reactions and chains of events
