- how to follow other [[digital gardens]]?
- feeds, rss etc
- but many are self-built with unique structures/updates may not be formatted well
- ideally properly *connecting* to the other gardens. 
- linked graphs, [[collaborative knowledge|knowledge sharing]], [[knowledge lineage]]
- obviously many attempted solutions at this problem in this niche research area and in tech but still so much [[platforms and silos|siloing]]. [Anytype](https://anytype.io/) is the most bold in its promises to manage this iirc 
- block protocol?
- i have my own ideas on production of an ecosystem, but what's needed most is better [[interoperability]] between various experiments 
- there are definitely measures here i'm forgetting!
