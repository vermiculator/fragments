## Notes
- comments and commentary
- comments vs posts, annotations vs documents, etc
- tiktok stitches like/unline youtube response videos
- Ways to say what you want with less characters in comments, or to be more succinct, or simplify for more understanding, and also consider whether you have to comment on it at all, or if it should be private or in a different sphere, and all this depends on your purpose for posting/commenting etc
- Who are you posting or commenting for? Audience, purpose, authenticity, living/working/loving/creating in public
- Is it ethical to dissect comments the way people dissect videos? How many people are commenting from vulnerable positions, or are children etc, bc it's easier to comment than post and is an almost universal thing but we don't talk about it
