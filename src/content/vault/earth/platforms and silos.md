## Mentions

- "Since the introduction of timeline, one might see Facebook as a passport to participating in the most prevalent form of capturing, mediating, and archiving personal life accounts." 
	- "Facebook locks the subject into a specific techno-economic regime of navigation through mediated memories. There is a contract and transaction written into every passport. In return for the right to freely cross borders, the authority has right to control this mobility, while acquiring insight into the subject’s personal information."
