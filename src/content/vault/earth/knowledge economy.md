- parallel shifts in knowledge, media and authority
- knowledge as economy, research tied to market logics
- post war 1945, production outsourced overseas, shift from industry to intellectual capital
- higher education as tool for economic growth, innovation and funding
- specialised siloed knowledge, disciplines, mode 1 - no longer suited to the media/service/knowledge economy, applied interdisciplinary mode 2 knowledge, information society, symbolic and digital goods
- prestige based on abstraction, neutrality, expertise in 'universal truths' - distant and detached
- mode 2 as instrumental knowledge, emerging in the 80s
- shifting to engage in practise, no longer knowledge for its own sake, social outcome, knowledge 'in context of application' (Nowotny et al., 2001), knowledge with measurable outcomes
- legal and economic structures to support the shift - eg copyright
- wider demand for newer university-style education as information production more central to economy
- creative economy, digital transformations
- always a varied global modes of production coexisting - agricultural/industrial or information/theoretical/creative
- interdisciplinary and policy-driven work
- rise of consultancy and performative metrics
- mode 3 in response - plural, participatory
- reflecting on the process
- recognising the complexity of knowing
- research as collaborative co-production, not to/around people but with them
- digital humanities, context and power, design justice
- legitimacy now not prestige-based or economic but tied to inclusion, [[ethics of care]], accountability, etc
