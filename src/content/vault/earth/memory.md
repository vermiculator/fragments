- Long-term memory: can learn through three methods: semantic, episodic, associative
- Recognise-Act Cycle 'associativity': on each cycle contents of working memory linked to items in long-term memory
- Discrimination Principle 'cues': retrieval determined by candidates that exist in memory relative to cues
- Power Law of Practice: better with practise ie skilled behaviour with muscle memory
- Create cues, any stimulus that creates an association eg mnemomics, icons etc
- But we cannot control the linkage which is why unlearning is hard
- 'Fog of relevance' what is important?
- 'schema' shared mental frameworks to hook semantic meaning onto
- Schema modification: accretion (reinforcing), tuning (modify the original schema), restructuring (too different, results in a new schema, generally bad but can result in innovation)
