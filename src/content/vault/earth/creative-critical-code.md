research, art, tech, linguistics, etc --> what exists in code and similar logical/mathematical/linguistic frameworks, as creative works and critical research

spent a lot of time adjacent to these concepts in both my undergrad degree (programming language design and implementation) and Masters (creative coding was a module offered, i just had saturated my options already) 

exploring from sidelines with limited time and split focus


* playing with concepts of file storage and data loss

* Esoteric.Codes covers algorithmic theater, computational poetry, conlangs, ephemeral digital performance, disruptive codes, weird hc/i, differential thought platforms, the digital ephemeral, null programs and deletions, unstable linguistics, structure as content, machine disobedience, new relationships between programmers and their primary progeny (bugs), useless machines (Shannon/Minksy), synthetic languages, circuitous systems, constraint sets for coders, paraconsistent calculi, and other platforms, systems, and languages that challenge the conventions of computing.
