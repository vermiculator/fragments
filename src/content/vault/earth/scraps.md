- Victorian scraps as collectibles - small scale art collecting
- limited edition but only due to labour involved
- magazine cutouts and posters etc as mass-produced scraps
- allowing new forms of collaging arts
- modern scrapbooking as personal collections, memory stores
- immortalising ephemera 
- screenshots as digital scraps
- digital collage widely reproduced but never as primary method of storing scraps - never a scrapbook application that takes advantage of the [use different metaphors](living documents|living nature]] of digital documents - retaining both originals and arrangement as both easily accessible - there gave been attempts but they tend to [[start with the right metaphor) and deprioritise expressibility or storage or privacy 
- clip art and early-digital design and graphics as digital scraps
- quick access clip art shifting to stock photo
- the software not ready for expressivity at that time
- digital art packs for designers, vectors for sale, eg Creative Market, digitised version of bits packs for physical card making
- stickers as a later evolution, maybe also held back by the wrong metaphor, attempting to hang somewhere between emoji (and other keyboard accessible evolutions such as AI created image ) and image - sent in larger scale or by MMS, not in eg unicode
- reaction images and gifs in eg forums, Tumblr, 2010s Twitter
- image signatures, comment signatures, html signatures, from forums to emails
- introducing small everyday creativity with card making from digital scraps eg inbuilt in Gubbins game
- NFTs as artificially scarce digital scraps - removing the benefits of digitising by returning to victorian era of scrap scarcity
