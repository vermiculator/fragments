- "[Bourriaud’s (2002)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244015626493#bibr6-2158244015626493) concept of relational aesthetics that conceptualizes art practice away from the “self-referentiality of modernist art,” turning instead to the way art-making builds relationships with others and with the world. Bourriaud believes that collaborative art and media making provide a space to explore these relations and our identity as it evolves through them. Here, relations, not media objects, are primary. A collective aesthetic means “our values are embedded in our physical and affective relationship with the world” ([Leuthold, 1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244015626493#bibr19-2158244015626493), p. 16)." - on arts-based research with indigenous communities -

- "How can I create delight in my writing? In drawing, we use Size and scale,  Dark and light, Close and far, Sharp and blurred... If a subject blends in too much with its surroundings, make it stand out through vocabulary, line breaks, bold/italics, kill some words to make snappy sentences... draw out a moment to change the pace. Create tension. Use the full range of the medium, and learn by observing how others do it too." - lost source
