- 'super-soldier' tropes, 'super-cop' tropes
- but also a lot of government taskforce/military presence/foreign invader narratives
- very blatant in examples from various comic book eras
    - interesting as other comic universes/publications/stories skewed sci-fi, which commonly skews anti-authoritarian
- in Marvel Cinematic Universe era (roughly 2000-2020)
- superhero worlds almost always US-centric, and often individualistic tropes

- also how Disney buying Marvel/increase in streaming over/downfall of cinema led to a swathe of Disney+ superhero-adjacent TV series, the change in format then allowed for the start of a more experimental era (eg Wandavision, Loki). 
    - DC actually found success in TV earlier than Marvel but Marvel's evolution is more interesting as DC's shows are commonly reminiscent of any other 2010s US action/drama/with some fantastical elements.
