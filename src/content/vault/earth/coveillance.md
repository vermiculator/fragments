## Mentions

- "Mann understood coveillance as a positive effect of the democratization of consumer-dedicated photo-capturing technologies. 
	- In a coveillant society “actions of all may, in theory, be observable and accountable to all,” rendering the authorities behind surveillance mechanisms eventually disempowered (Mann et al., 2003, p.347)."

	- "We are far from the utopian, “coveillance” scenario built upon a common pact where everyone tracks oneself and by implication the others on a daily basis. Consequently, we are far from a scenario in which everyone passively captures one’s life (and others’) for the greater benefit of society."
