- This site is written by a single human author and presents my (fleeting or lasting) opinion alone
- In some areas this will be closer to expertise and in others more like speculation
- Often quick thoughts and unsourced claims will relate to my own context and experience
- Don't take advice from these pages without also consulting other sources
- Take this as a general rule of information processing, especially on the internet
- That said, I don't intend to mislead and will provide some sources [[digital gardens will always need further citation|when and where possible]].
