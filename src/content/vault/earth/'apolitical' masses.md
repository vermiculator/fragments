- nobody is outside of politics
---

- apolitical as ignorant
    - by choice, or
    - by lack of access to education, or
    - by circumstance preventing mental space/engagement/etc
- apolitical as undecided
    - not deciding on a political party isn't the same as being undecided on political factors in general
    - you enact your values every day, [[be the change]]
    - the personal is political
    - humans are a social species and politics is concerned with social arrangements
    - your life is affected by others' politics
    - your material situation is dictated strongly by economic currents
- apolitical as centrist
    - centrism favours already dominant forces
    - there are many cases in which not supporting the oppressed or even the underdog is either implicit or very tangible support for the oppressor
- apolitical as privileged
    - those with marginalised identities are politicised by their very existence
    - some people are afforded 'opting out' as a choice and others aren't
    - often quite literally, as in, you can't opt out of being killed for others' politics
- apolitical as objective
    - there is no true objective opinion
    - [[science is all theories]], science is not objective
    - [[data is not neutral]], [[earth/technology is not neutral]]
    - neither is any one belief system or knowledge system
    - the best we have is [[intersubjectivity]] and [[pluriversality]]
