- tipping the iceberg to break the system - mass continuous online movement, protesting the social environment
- membership politics, monetisation, the introduction of these capitalist constructs into what is designed as a social activity/destination for literal children 
- insights: organising is easier when it's fun, children have the time and interest in mass protest, people can and will protest even when they aren't quite sure why, ineffectual action can still have valuable side effects
