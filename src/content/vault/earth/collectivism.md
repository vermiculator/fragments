used here as a deliberately general term, referring to leftist politics that emphasise communal care and ownership; not necessarily in neglect of the individual. I intend particularly to encompass anti-capitalist, anti-fascist, intersectional feminist, decolonialist and environmental movements. The closest specific political connotation I'm making is with **[[communalism]]** and **[[anarcho-communism]]** in the tradition of [Bookchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin) and [Kropotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin).
