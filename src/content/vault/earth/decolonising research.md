	- citations / databases / publishing norms
- historically complicit institutions still structurally similar, hierarchies
- alternative knowledge systems still erased or devalued
- using instead Feminist, Indigenous and participatory methods
- alternative approaches to centre healing, land, relationship, ceremony
