- “awareness does not automatically lead to change” (p. 293). - [Rico Lie (2008)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244015626493#bibr21-2158244015626493), 
- "Information alone does not generate changes, whereas communication—which implies participation, sharing of knowledge in a horizontal way, and respect for diversity and culture—is key to social change." (p. 3) [Gumucio-Dagron (2003)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244015626493#bibr11-2158244015626493)
