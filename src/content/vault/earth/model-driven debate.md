## The Concept
When arguing a point based on specific facts, we could ensure the accuracy of a statement in real time, directly within its content, by structuring it as a live element.

## Notes
- in-text stats
- written content with words that appear with piped options?
- monospace code blocks already common, bring in more formulas eg closer to tex
- bringing mathematic and logical language more naturally integrated into internet convo, changing how we bring in rationality and logic to argument and discussion, allowing for dialogues to contain multiple levels of understanding in one space
- the web already changes the experience of reading, considering that pages are updated or live feeds, and there are many ways to technically handle content that changes
	- consequences of this
		- citations from internet sources are timestamped
		- archival services crucial, eg internet archive's wayback machine and similar efforts
		- later-deleted statements, like a retraction or redaction, legal and political implications
		- screenshot as 'citizen proof' due to accessibility of tools
			- but images easily doctored and for general population source-checking is non-comprehensive because [people assume truth](people assume truth#^7b0804)
