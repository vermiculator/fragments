title: faux-diversity
---

- how those in homogenous cultures can still see some value in diversity so co-opt the language or general appearance of diversity without internalising the core tenants
- in both culturally appropriative use of superficial aspects or aesthetics or practices of diverse cultures, but also in merely the concept of only very slight differences and uniquenesses
    - those White American Baby Names eg Jaeden Jaiyden Jeiyden
        - this also a result of specific religious groups enforcing certain sets of names?
- 'weird, but not TOO weird'
- to stand out a little (but mostly fit in)
- like a 'diversity hire' of someone with some small difference who nevertheless fits very neatly into your homogenous group 
    - the one black friend to 'diversify' your Christmas24/Hallmark film
        - also saw someone describe this as a modern iteration of the 'Mammy' trope which is a great take
    - hard-marketing your one gay staff member who is incredibly straight-laced and Conservative when queerer people are unwelcome to apply
- mirroring the closely-competitive brands, products and companies that are foundationally similar but slightly repackaged, to provide a feeling of newness and uniqueness without actually experimenting too far from the norm
