## colonialism
- colonialism as a global system of domination driven by European conquest, trade and empire
- occupation, extraction, cultural suppression
- 'justified' through racial hierarchies, [[white saviour complex|white saviour narrative]], missionary work
- orientalism, East vs West, North vs South, etc
- not just the 'legacy' of colonialism, the structures still surround us
- [[decolonising research]]
- hierarchies of race, culture, bodies, religion
- making land, resources and social systems 'legible' to colonisers, by erasing identity
- less 'developed' nations supposedly in need of guidance
- institutions that still dominate often directly profited (and still exist due to the ongoing effects of) colonialism
- museums, collections, 'primitive' objects and knowledge systems, [[earth/ripped from context|ripped from context]]
