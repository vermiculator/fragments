title: neutrality and objectivity
---

Academic research, scientific knowledge, institutional claims, constructed technologies and theories are not neutral expressions of an objective truth.

- neutrality / objectivity upholds dominant systems
- post60s began critiques from feminist, indigenous, postcolonial scholars on academic authority
- destabilising this force by expanding boundaries of the framework through public, activist and participatory forms
- specific disciplines of study emerging from this ([[inside agents]]/[[be the change]]) as well as external resistance ([[can't put it out from inside the house]]/[[the masters tools]]/[[the revolution will not be televised]])
