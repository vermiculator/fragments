## Mentions

- "official archival institutions can be seen as preoccupied with assimilating individual voices into unified, formalized, coherent, logical collective narratives, para-archives might be seen as concerned with **acknowledging the heterogeneity and plurality of micro-perspectives**, forms of alterity that might be incompatible with the mainstream, strategic, and regulatory."
