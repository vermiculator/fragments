---

- rooted in feminist and relational ethics
- challenging traditional 'masculine' methods without comprising the rigor
- context-specific and non-universal
- care is not neutral, intersectional identities and inequalities
- focus on situated knowledge, interdependence and vulnerability
- witnessing injustice as a responsibility, engaging from a position of power
- disowning the power and allowing for genuine relational care
- who carries the burden
- not soft or sentimental, but responsive and reflexive
- care is embedded in histories of harm
- dominant power forces don't disappear when we enter the field
- grounded in context, care in one situation may not be care in another
- accountable to people and systems you work within - a responsibility to the communities
- what are we failing to question
- move towards inconvenience
- care begins by recognising how power and ethics questions are embedded in systems and infrastructures
- be willing to change if it starts to cause harm
- responsibility and transformation
- is the research effective if nothing changes?
- are participants' voices mediated, abstracted or aestheticized
- are they framing the research too, what is the long-term implication
- care as recognition, reciprocity and responsibility
- if you hold information on someone's life you're now in continuous relationship with them, they're a part of you moving forward and them you
- reflect on how we are trained to claim knowledge
- the divide between the one who knows and about whom is known
- who gets to set the terms of what is reliable, vigorous, academic data
- what does research look like through more relational and plural approaches
- even with no direct participants you are still accountable to the people you're thinking about/talking about/excluding
