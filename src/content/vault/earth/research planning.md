- methodology is the overall approach, why and how
- connect your question to the theories of others
- research methods are the specific tools and activities

---

- a thesis is
	- writing a really long proof of why the question/hypothesis works and how your work proves it

- a thesis can be
	- you're allowed to eg build on other open source stuff
	- both practise-based and practise-led
	- mixed methods

- how to pick focus
	- what do i want to change
	- what makes me angry
	- what do i want to do for months
	- start with why
	- what is the story you want to tell
	- what do you want to convince people of

- how to pick methodology/frameworks
	- what are your values
	- what is supported by prior theory and practise
	- what integrates an ethics of care

- research done with care
	- contributing to community with this knowledge
	- addressing underpinning social/economic/political injustices
	- avoid repeating previous mistakes (thorough literature review)
	- aware you have blindspots (even on your blindspots)
	- proving reliability (consistency of measure) and validity (accuracy of measure) 
	- defensible - you should be able to defend your research, own what you say
