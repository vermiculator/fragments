- practise-based
- tangible from the outset
- brings depth to practise and gives theory practical purpose
- tapping into other knowledges
- starting with a making strategy -  sketching, problem space, or technical exercise
- making as a skill with technical fluency, or making to explore, or making to understand
- making through dialogue with others, co-experience
- unmaking through hacking, repairing, questioning consumption
- material research, affordances of a particular material and its possibilities
- iteration turns search into re-search - reflecting and refining methods, build depth over time
- making for the sake of making
- its through reflection, documentation and articulation that your making becomes research
- starting with questions
