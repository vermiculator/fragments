## Context
  - I am pro-public-ownership of all infrastructure, but my experience aligns more with goals to bring tech/network/web infrastructure to local communities so the notes here will likely reflect that.
## Notes
  - meet a community where they are, design for wide range of technical abilities
	- Building computers, printers, wifi hotspots, peripherals, servers, etc, and digital infrastructure from low tech, could be making use of funding allocated to bridging digital divide
	- [working from existing emergent groupings](reinventing%20the%20wheel.md) who may have constructed infrastructure of varying quality and usefulness already. Think community Facebook pages or the Nextdoor app for hyperlocal communities
