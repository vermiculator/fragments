- a theme arising in multiple places
- the violence of denying people their full context
- eg in huge topics like slavery, forced departure and asylum seeking, in invasion and colonialism and residential schools and forced adoptions and assimilation and stolen museum artifacts 
- even in more ambiguous or less huge ways like bad journalism or cultural appropriation and misquoting and data mismanagement and misinformation 
- and makes me wonder about image and sound and remix and reuse, when should things not be recirculated in partial form, when is it disrespectful to use 'found' things
