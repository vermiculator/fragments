- some consider tactics as short term and strategy long term, immediate methods and details vs overarching goals and principles
- others criticise this division between bottom-up and top-down practises that [[bottom up top down convergence|often converge]]

## critique of dichotomy
- "founded on an antagonistic relationship between strategies and tactics, discourses on tactical media practices tended to portray tactics (and resistance) as built upon a “hit-and-run” logic. In other words, tactics meant a sudden, spontaneous, disruptive, and unexpected intervention into a hegemonic structure (e.g. an institution or a technical system) from a supposedly autonomous and untraceable outside place, to temporarily paralyze its mechanisms and gain short-term benefits" [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^18e94e|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
- "the context of contemporary techno-cultural context in which a distinction between tactics and strategies becomes confused and blurred (cf. the conflation of sousveillance and surveillance)," [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^068d39|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
- see [[slow tactics]]
- "unhinge the notion of the tactical from its opposition to the strategic."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k3rk3djyev873ttmtn17t5d3)
- what starts as strategy can become tactical, tactics under strategy, and later these images become part of other strategies/tactics too - past instrumentalised for future
- Highmore argues de Certau's view that strategy/tactics division as unhelpful as reduces everything to oppressor/oppressed, when in reality societies always have both dominant practises and its normative institutions as well as minor practises that persist but don't control discourse [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^f91252|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
- "Strategies and tactics ought not to be seen as forces at two opposite ends of an axis. Tactics are not always about a direct and rapid response to a strategic force, but might also evolve silently as the result of an “inventive employment of possibilities within strategic circumstances” (Highmore, 2002, p.159) [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^b524f5|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
- "\[Tactics] do not operate outside the strategy that they seemingly confront: “to do this would require a counter-strategy, they are in an ambiguous position of being inside but ‘other’: they escape it without leaving it” (Highmore, 2002, p.159)"  [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^b524f5|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
