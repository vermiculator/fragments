- when its participatory the goal is ultimately to do your best to solve the problem of that one person
- understand the agency of the people that are the subject of the data, make it so it benefits them

- ethics throughout entire research path, meaning and purpose
- incorporating critical ethics and frameworks
- Greek ethos meaning character, habit, dwelling, way of being, disposition, way of approaching the world
- in research there are common principles it aligns with
- what kind of researcher do you want to be, what kind of person do you want to be
- any conversation is a chance to hold your power

- ethics in relation specifically to systemic, calculated harm
- often ethical milestones in the past are in relation to aftermath of harm (eg Nuremburg Code) rather than future-building - reactionary
- informed consent - includes clear and accessible information, no coercion, and ongoing, revocable consent
- consent is both a legal contract and an ongoing relationship of trust and care
- Declaration of Helsinki (1964) - weighing risk against benefits
- Belmont Report (1979) - respect, beneficence and justice
- exploitation under the name of science
- academia as a colonial institution itself and the need to deconstruct it throughout, new methodologies

- Institutional Review Boards established to oversee human research - example impetus for this is Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932 - 1972)
- Drug testing regulations came from the effects of thalidomide in pregnancy
-  by the mid-20th century ethical considerations shift to social sciences, humanities, cultural space

- positionality and power dynamics between researchers and participants
- research is never neutral
- who speaks and who listens, what is considered knowledge
- what do we owe each other, what can we give each other
- holding uncertainty and complexities and sitting in it
- no longer necessarily 'experimenting with bodies' but foundationally that still happens all the time actually
- rise of University Research Ethics Committees modelled on IRBs, through the 1990s
- National Committee for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and Humanities released first guidelines in 1993, emphasising respect for cultural norms and participant autonomy
- ethics submission is the core of methodology when working with subjects of equalities and justice

- 'do no harm' includes psychological, social and reputational harm - embarrassment, discomfort and misrepresentation
- privacy and confidentiality as respect, as care
- you can't pass on that trust, details carry risk
- upfront clarity on any claims or guarantees of anonymity, do they want to be seen or unseen
- respect for the agency of individuals under all circumstances
- being honest about your goals, methods and affiliations to everyone involved - those your research touches is the primary audience, those who are systemically disempowered
- 'what is going to happen to my story?'
- in autoethnography you'll be more cognizant of this question too because its your own story
- pretending ethics are universal is a kind of violence
- unlearning, undoing, switching framework if it doesn't fit the people you're working with
- begin with listening, avoiding extractive modes
- reflexivity - ethics as process


- Digital Modernity (1960s–1980s), new challenges developing with computing, IP and surveillance, profitable data, early networks
- Digital Post-Modernity - internet, algorithms, disinformation and big data
- sensitive data moves from name/contact/demographic to detailed metadata and fingerprinting
- blurring of public and private data online
- emerging organisations eg Association of Internet Researchers developing guidelines, but not keeping pace
- AI ethics

- not inherently less impactful when not meeting participants directly
- misrepresentative data and excluded users are still collateral - who suffers as a result of what you're studying, it is not disconnected
- avoiding 'styling' harm, what shouldn't be abstracted, and whose pain is legible
- what you choose not to do - 'decide' - killing other options - resolving into a singular choice

- critical enquiries on sensitive material can create new harms - how to work with trauma
- people as gateways to systems, situated knowledges of those implementing policy or observing contradictions, silent actors caught in hierarchies
- infrastructural data - NDAs, internal policy constraints, legal obligations, moral conflicts, loyalty and safety
- from subjects to co-creators - beyond consent - agency and authorship
- shared ownership/authorship
- tokenistic use of 'participation', participation without power is extraction
