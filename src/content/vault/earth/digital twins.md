## Notes
- TODO
- Keeping it up to date, two way data flow
- Single source of truth in design systems, does the physical take precedence or the desired theoretical? 
- Physical twins of digital systems too?
- 'views' for data varied by application, could apply to physicality too, EG map models irl
- Keeping digital twins up to date in not just data but entire structure
- 3d manufactured parts, quite literally a digital backup
- Digital simulation of physical properties of materials EG as used in animation etc, but also other properties.
- useful in manufacturing etc but maybe extending the boundaries of what is ethical when eg the workers become part of the machine being recorded/analysed/twinned/monitored
- low power embedded tech, self-powered data transfer
