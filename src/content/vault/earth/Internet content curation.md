- the many ways in which this comes about in each new age of too much noise.
- particular sites or blogs curating good content
- Facebook pages or other social media accounts that curate external content
- clip compilations for video formats
- repost-only blogs and short-form video accounts
- search engine curation that has now become AI assisted search
- personality driven clip shows on traditional and newer media with varying levels of success
- the whole genre of reddit rereads 
- currently, substack(?) or medium subscriptions or general email newsletters that feature miscellaneous links, signal a return to earlier internet need fir curation but now due to oversaturation
