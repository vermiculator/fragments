most 'pages' here are mostly empty. i create them as links from other pages, or because i know its a concept i refer to frequently, or that i have resources i'd 'tag' with that phrase, or this is a 'seed' to plant or a 'thread' to pull, or just generally a standalone [[what counts as an atomic fragment|atomic]] fragment

---

this is partly due to legacy systems, partly by whim, partly by choice. in the future the interface and routing mechanisms will [[there is no primary data type|better respect when links are more important than content]]. for now, there may just be a lot that seems empty. 

it is often an external cue for something in my brain or in the world to which i want to refer without attempting to rewrite every thought i've ever had.

there are more concrete theory-based justifications also - external mnemonic traces are useful despite their partiality, [[redlinks are important]], [[digital gardens are never 'finished']] and [[messy data|naturalistic data is messy]]
