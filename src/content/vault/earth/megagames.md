- LARP adjacent, TTRPG adjacent
- to pull these off it requires both good large event organising and good performance-event design and good story/world building AND good game design. To achieve all of this is WILD
- and that's only the stuff required for conceptualising the thing, not the marketing/digital resources/audience building/relationship building/staff building/physical resourcing
- it's wild to me that humans can do this and it kinda sounds amazing
- organising towards actual causes through these methods? keeping real important causes fun can be more difficult 
- distributed versions as well as single venue 
- the COORDINATION 

## Examples
- Geocaching
- Blast Theory - can you see me now, Sheffield map of runners, use of PDA data, online players chasing offline players
- Uncle Roy All Around You, Manchester, underworld conspiracy ARG type thing, codes for buildings, geocaching style, your image on billboards - massive coordination efforts, matched with random pen pal to support each other
