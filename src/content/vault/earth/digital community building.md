## Notes
- I've witnessed and been a part of a variety of digital communities but have no sociological framework to see how and why some work better than others
- There are increasingly now paid roles in digital community building, moderation, support, etc
- so there must be a developing 'best practice' etc 
- Incredibly subjectively, neocities feels like how tumblr used to feel (in early to mid 2010s)
- I've seen people describe TikTok like early YouTube 
- wikipedia, wikihow, open source
- open and closed discords, discord for tech
- streaming communities
- tiktok niches
