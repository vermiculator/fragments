commonly with bespoke, self-designed systems you are working in a small team or as an individual, so the ecosystem is poorly maintained/documented, relies on legacy components, etc due to huge labour requirements on a continuous basis

## Mentions

- "downsides characterizing self-designed frameworks. Precisely such issues as incompatibility with the newest versions of browsers, operating systems, problems with responsiveness on mobile devices can be seen as some vast disadvantages. Personally developed structure, especially if one’s programming skills are not continuously exercised and regularly updated, can get quickly sidetracked and outdated in the context of popular, mainstream technological developments. This is obviously a disadvantage if one looks from a perspective of someone willing to be in constant touch with the rest of the online realm and sees value in a constant refashioning of technologies and thus the modes of living with them.
