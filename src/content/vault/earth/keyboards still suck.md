Keyboards still suck
	- I hate this thing, I'm disabled
	- History, standard and alternative layouts
	- Wildcards and innovations of past, standard split
	- Communities, modding, etc
	- Chording
	- Projection and finger based
	- That whole rig thing good potential 
	- Specific applications
	- standard mechanical is still best but not great
	- Ties into general ergonomics, [[body politics]], [[movement politics]]
