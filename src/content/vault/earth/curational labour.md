title: curational labour

- the more thoughtful, deliberate and contextual the curation is, the more labour is involved
- curators and art directors have to be incredibly intentional with the narratives they're weaving through objects/media
- but essentially to be a curator is just to have taste, amateurs acts of curational labour go uncompensated constantly eg online
- should some curators be more highly praised/paid for having a particular taste?
- who discerns whose taste is 'discerning'?
- with increase of automated, passive 'curation' through machine learning, 'tastes' are homogenized and non-specific, to look actively through a particular lens you've hand-crafted is to resist this automisation of culture
