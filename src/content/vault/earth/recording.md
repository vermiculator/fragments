## Mentions

- "According to this etymological perspective, recording stands for active and thoughtful processes of internalizing, ordering thoughts, remembering, calling them to mind, rethinking and being attentive. Recording is thus a deliberate construction of a mnemonic trace in which one’s agency and intention are the determining forces; the dynamics of recording occurs in integral relation to one’s mental and corporeal capacities."
