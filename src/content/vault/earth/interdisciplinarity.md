- multiple disciplines inform the process 
- important to not get context-stuck in one area or one framework, insights come from anywhere
- different disciplines ask different questions and collect different kinds of data
- disciplines are for structuring and relating to others processes - descriptive not prescriptive
- disciplines explain and justify the complexities of what you're actually doing
- expanding the qualitative box, the boundaries of knowing
- to create literacies to show how eg tech / science / whatever framework can function to create inequalities
- understanding disciplines and bring them into conversation, interface and entangle them, pluriversality
- humanities - sources/collections, social sciences data/datasets
- transdisciplinary, slightly alternatively
