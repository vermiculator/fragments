title: symbiosis of theory and practise
aliases:
  - praxis
parent:
  - "[[earth/research methods|research methods]]"
---

- several quotes of 'theory without practise is X and practise without theory is X'
- fundamentally, for the most benefit we need both to [[how to make change|make change]] 
- practise based research - learning by doing the thing - but with research rigor
- creative exploration through practise -- practise without the academic rigor 
- practise can inform research through prototyping revealing issues or new sub-questions
- use practise to test, challenge and extend theory as well as strengthen research argument
- not separate methods, dynamic interplay and your own combination
- theory stops at critique and practise stops at functionality. in the gap between we keep moving iteratively
- abstract theory as inherently non-relational when we are learning to be relational as care
- can develop design principles from theory work and/or data
- can take not a tech-centred approach, a methods-centred and inequality-centred approach
