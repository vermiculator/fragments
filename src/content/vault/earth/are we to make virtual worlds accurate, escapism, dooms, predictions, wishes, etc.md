title: are we to make virtual worlds accurate, escapism, dooms, predictions, wishes, etc

## Links
- [[imagining alternatives]]
## Notes
- in games, books, art, RPGs, etc
- how are we to portray the world
- we kinda need all of these for different purposes 
- eg utopias ad dystopias in fantasy ad sci-fi both tell us something of the socioeconomic placetime of the author
- artistic movements in representation, realism, impressionism etc
- an old question reinvigorated by newer mediums 
- eg now 'life simulation' as a 'game' genre, attempts at both abstraction and realism are well-loved

## Mentions
- "Virtual worlds can be better than the actual world. They can be more moral, more just, more progressive, more empathetic, and more accommodating of difference. And if they can be, shouldn’t they be?” [[library/Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow|(1)]]
