Proprietary work slows progress and innovation

---

- important insights missed by [[unwilling competitors]]
- need for extra work on reporting and analysis to make use of updated processes and knowledge within the organisation - lack of transparency means inaccurate, misleading or not particularly useful reports, and a lot of work is wasted when project work is archived or disposed of, individuals' growth not propagated to others, skills and processes and insights lost when staff move on
- lose out on cross-industry or cross-discipline knowledge
- for those who believe in [[working in public]] is there any responsibility/liability in regards to how particular thoughts or unfinished works are interpreted/used by others?
- with particular importance in eg early stage scientific research on controversial topics
- when, if ever, is it completely necessary to keep knowledge or insights or theories private? different for each of these categories? geo-politics and terrorism. weapons in the hands of your enemy. who defines enemy.
- human efforts wasted on reconstructing and reverse-engineering
- human efforts wasted on [unneccesary or undesirable redundancy](redundancy%201.md) - eg redesigning under similar constraints and converging on the same idea, where steps could've been skipped by utilising previous work
