## Notes
- Bookmarking short form content
- eg tiktoks yt shorts etc
- silo-ed solutions of varying quality
- hard to transfer
- tweets often embedded or screenshotted as links to them are annoying and previews variable
- permalinks of tumblr blog posts are better
- links to how screenshots and web-weaving is used for personal archival
