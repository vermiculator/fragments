title: adversarial data mining

- thinking on how hyper-precision l, huge levels of data capture and hard mining it is dangerous in the wrong hands
- eg segmenting a group to target, discriminating against a group by associated characteristics indirectly 
- correlation != causation
- hyper-precise data capture with no specific goal (eg with machine learning) could surface correlations before mainstream science has this data
- seeded by considering [[not everything should be IoT capable]] on seeing IoT toothbrushes and hypothesising a danger, what if the statistical likelihood of low dental hygiene in certain medical conditions could cause unwarranted and nonconsensual segmenting of this population of toothbrush users
