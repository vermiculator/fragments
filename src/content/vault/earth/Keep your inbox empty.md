Just here to counter and clarify "[[Keep your inbox full]]". Email inboxes, message inboxes and personal storage of documents that are over-used and/or under-maintained are not only a privacy issue but take a lot of unnecessary energy and add to mental clutter. I know its no-one's priority but managing it well is useful if you can. Most of the issue here does lie in over-collection of data in the first place.

- please delete old emails and archive deliberately and thoughtfully
- There is so much over-storage and it's a data management nightmare that breaks privacy strongholds and takes a lot of energy to store
- destroy old hard-drives
- orgs and software need to [not collect so much data in the first place](collect less data)
- individuals might benefit from being more deliberate with eg personal phone photos etc
