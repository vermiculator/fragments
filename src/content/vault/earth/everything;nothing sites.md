'e/n' sites are an early internet phenomena still held up by some independent site authors. The term refers to a site that means *everything* to you and *nothing* to anyone else, by prioritising your interests alone. A blog with no specific audience.

- whilst much of this site is somewhat thematic, in the spirit of e/n sites I write on disparate topics side by side and see where new thoughts fit into my existing web.
- some thinkers/writers/creatives/academics/content creators have found ways to cater to a wide range of topics and interests whilst maintaining some level of cohesion/retaining their audience. how have they done this?
