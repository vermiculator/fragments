basis of the internet hasn't fundamentally changed despite the encroachment of [[big tech]], it is still possible to harness old tools, old software, etc, in many cases. many examples of modern tech built in a way that works with or on legacy systems. many of the people from web 1.0 are still here too, existing in a parallel indieweb space.
