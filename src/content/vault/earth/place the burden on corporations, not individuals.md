There is frequent messaging from brands and nations to make an individual difference to big problems like climate change. Whilst individuals can make small impacts the majority of the damage is orchestrated by corporations and there should be far more insistence that they reduce the harms they are producing.

- to a certain extent corporations are made up of humans, some with more responsibility than others
