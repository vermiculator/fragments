- "one certain imperative that unites media archaeologist is their “discontent with the supremacy of the “canonized” narratives of media culture and history’ (Parikka & Huhtamo, 2011, p.3, Ernst, 2011, p.240)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0pwqr8nrxctf20njv8wcxv5
- "call for an interventionist mode on reflecting on and critiquing media."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0pwpa3758yt9cqdta40cjtp)
- "media archaeology “moves fluidly between disciplines, although it does not have a permanent home” (2011, p.3). It avoids stabilization and formalization into an easily applicable set of analytical tools, which as the authors argue allows it to become something of an interdisciplinary perspective on technologies, a “travelling discipline” that “roams across the landscape of the humanities and social sciences and occasionally leaps into the arts” (ibid., p.3)."

- "such an approach also brings in some risks of atomization, unrigorousness and too broad dispersion of points of interests."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0pwzjn0834dk1h9yta8mpxr)
