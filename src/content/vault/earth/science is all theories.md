- scientific theories are the latest, most-correct theories
- peer review is crucial for ensuring results are repeatable, replicable, trustworthy
- as every human's view is subjective and the material world objective, we can only reach towards this objectivity through maximal [[intersubjectivity]]
- theres a lot more for me to explore on this - the whole philosophy of science
- science is one framework of understanding, amongst others. that doesn't invalidate the importance of correct and stringent scientific practise - just that scientific practitioners need to appeal not only to [[rationality]] when dealing with [[humans are inherently irrational creatures]]
