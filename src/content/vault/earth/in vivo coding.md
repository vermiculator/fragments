- use participants' own words and phrases in open coding
- direct reference rather than encoding something into it
- still have to consider carefully what fits categories and what is crucially distinct
- preserves their own meaning-making
- culturally specific language and not acadmeic jargon
- if its too filtered through your language it might miss the point
- great for discourse analysis, cultural studies, and research on how people construct meaning through words
- crucial in multilingual research to reduce miscommunication
- can preserve slang or professional terminology
- more appropriate for sensitive topics to not erase emotional emphasis
- good for grounded theory as data directly creates theory
- first step in [[thematic analysis]] before broader themes emerge
