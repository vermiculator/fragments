## The Concept
- Some comparisons, dichotomies or discussions will last or reappear for  numerous periods of history, in numerous cultures and by numerous groups of people, with seemingly no chance of resolution. These are debates that may seem fundamentally human, or fundamental to a particular field of study.

## Notes
- some are effectively resolved with newer theories or greater scientific understanding or through interdisciplinary work, eg 'what came first, the chicken or the egg' is essentially solved by evolutionary science (egg)
- some are seriously contentious and some are played for fun eg common icebreakers or 'would you rather' style questions 
## Examples
- nature vs nurture
- determinism vs free will 
- [[revolt vs reform]]
