optimisation not in the [[anti~capitalism|capitalist]] efficiency sense but optimising for well-being, ecosystem balance, social harmony, etc


eg emphasising simplification of visuals and functions and language to serve a less literate population rather than focusing on optimising the technical setup or a cost/privacy trade-off
