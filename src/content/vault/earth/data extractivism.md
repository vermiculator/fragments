title: data extractivism
---

- eg as applies to less-than-ethical research with eg indigenous communities
- but also as applies to users of [[Web 2.0]] services and platforms, digital forms of data, [[hidden data flows]] and [[data exhaust]], the 'extraction imperative' that sees wasted opportunity in possibilities for data collection to be sold on to train predictive models ([[AI|AI ethics]])
	- users forcibly becoming data subjects
	- more data is extracted than what is needed for the service
	- beyond online life - data from daily experience, mics in products
	- serving the business model and corporate interest
