## Notes
- no cars - mass public transport and last-mile transport
- need for better local waste triage
  - reduce mental load on the consumer, 'out of your hands' with an actual guarantee of sustainable reuse and recycling
	- but also more direct, in-community waste management with consumer involvement as service for community
- more public toilets, accessible and public use
- similar small public conveniences
- smart grids for mass energy management, but also provision for self-managed isolated energy production
