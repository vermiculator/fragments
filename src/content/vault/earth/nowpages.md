- a concept from web 1.0, personal pages on personal sites
- extendible, connectable?
- up-to-date status-like feed at varying intervals. where did 'status updates' fail and succeed eg msn statuses vs Facebook statuses vs Discord current activity
- relates to idea of friend-refinding eg forums and sites and then Facebook eclipsed it
- conceptualising a reconnector that respects right to be forgotten and allows different pathways for different information retained. against sites auto-populating contacts from arbitrary parts of life, for circle/group/org/etc style routing
- i follow somewhat the nowpage idea within past/present/future so /now redirects to /present
- who is the audience of [[everything;nothing sites]]? explicitly, no-one

- [klardotsh](https://klar.sh/trash) writes reasons for deleting their nowpage - interesting to me as i don't see it as needing the frequency of update this presumes
	- "Anyway - a `/now` page is a really cool idea - a well-known path on indie sites to let folks know, at an executive summary level, what you’re up to right now! Splendid, right? For me, the format never really fit my lifestyle or energy levels, and so I’ve canned the page for now. Maybe I’ll give it another go some day. A Now page is predicated on the assumption that one’s life is highly varied over time, and noteworthy (or at least, I feel that my `/now` updates should be noteworthy, to be worth reading at all). While my life is highly varied _in general_, with a long list of hobbies and projects and interests, it’s rarely varied _over time_. I have my lanes, and I mostly stick to them. When I take on new projects, they tend to be large in scale, and slow in completion. I’m also highly seasonal, with my winter and early spring largely booked out for volunteering work with FIRST Robotics (modulo a half-dozen and change weekends I get to truly disconnect in those months), meaning my late spring through early fall is typically the time when I can actually dedicate real cycles to getting anything “cool” done." - (accessed 23/02/25)
- [Jake Bauer](https://www.paritybit.ca/blog/an-update-about-this-very-webbed-site/) also deleted their nowpage, replacing it with functionally identical smaller parts - this is still within the ethos of nowpages, and many will visit a homepage by default anyway. but /now is still good for discoverability i'd argue
	- "So now I have a little “Now Reading” and “Now Investigating” blurb on my front page (which, coincidentally is also where the Colophon and About and Contact information live), and that’s good enough along with maybe an occasional status update blog post when I actually have something to say."
