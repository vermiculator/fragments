- avoiding jargon, general literacy advice
 - general best practices for copy-writing for web/in software/about software?
 - do they still use kid/school age for reading/comprehension graded levels? and if so should they change that, could be patronising/disrespectful to both adult and child non-readers 
	- eg change to be in line with international language test proficiencies?
	- found a 2006 paper 'Assessing the reading comprehension of adults with learning disabilities' Jones, Long, Finlay - that uses 'reading ages' still, has the field moved on from there
	- "Gatehouse Books are broadly classified as Adult Beginner Readers \[…] graded as Very Easy (Level 1), Easy (Level 2), Standard (Level 3) Beginner Readers or Post-Beginner Readers (Level 4)" "We have deliberately steered away from flagging up reading ages or 'adult literacy' levels on any of our books. This is because it is important that the reader does not feel patronised or stigmatised in any way. Our wish is to make it easier for tutors to select suitable reading material \[…] without drawing attention to the learner's basic skills needs."
	- National Literacy Trust uses 'levels' from Entry Level 1 to 3 and Level 1-2
	- The OECD uses 'levels' 'Below Level 1' to Level 5
	- 'National Assessment of Adult Literacy' 'Below Basic' to 'Proficient, tiered quantitive test scores
	- Flesch-Kincaid readability tests
	- curated reading lists by teachers of additional languages, communities dedicated to this eg learnnatively.com
