title: analogue computing

  -  considering early input devices with natural motion and purpose, situated within built objects and playing off their already established physical properties and affordances
  - Special purpose analogue devices properly integrated within built environments
  - how ordinary people get creative with tools and materials to solve every day problems
  - the physicality of machinery vs opaque and obfuscating digital technology 
  - simple mechanical principles under-utilised, there are engineering solutions for a lot of daily tasks that are difficult to discover - think of the popularity of eg 'life hacks', 'home hacks', 'storage solutions' but no dedicated discussions of engineering for these problems, lack of knowledge and confidence for many to figure these things out, or little outlet to share them when they do - very ad-hoc social media spreading or search engine [[connecting ideas]]
		- an undervalued important function of a social web
		- undereducation in general solutions engineering in public education
