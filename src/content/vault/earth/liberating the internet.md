title: liberating the internet

- disconnected groups


eg
- anti web2.0 communities in socio-politics, policy, research etc
- anti web2.0 software practise 
- PKM productivity space
- PKM scholarly space
- everyday webdev practises
- collectivist/commons scholarship
- archival/library scholarship
- memory studies
- indie web, fediverse, open source
- disconnect between institutional information science and individual PKM space - bridged by individual scholars but lack of interoperability between highly-structured-academic and looser or more bespoke personal systems - little interfacing between approaches
- - memory studies and library studies and pkm world all skew towards students of set-curricula. i'm more personally interested (due to the expansive nature of the internet and mass of information that is messy and underused, as well as the resistive potential for those lacking access for whatever reason) in alt-academia, casual researchers, self-dedicated learners and independent students.
