- **Practice-Based Research**  
	- The creative artefact or intervention is the primary research output. 
	- The artefact is not illustrative, it generates insight.  
	- the creative product IS the research, that is the basis of your contribution to knowledge
	- prototype with documentation, eg interface that demonstrates the theories
	- research is embodied in the actual working system rather than just written about
	- eg build a tool to enable new processes
	- eg designing a speculative platform to visualise ~injustice~

- **Practice-Led Research**
	- The research is about practice itself. 
	- The focus is on learning from the process of making, building theory through reflective documentation and critical analysis.  
	- technical output is informed by theory
	- process of iteration is different
	- the writing is more important
	- focus on what you learned through the practise
	- produce various outputs but there is iterative inquiry, your initial methods feed into new methods
	- eg building a collaborative design toolkit for ~injustice~ and analysing how its use reshapes participation-
