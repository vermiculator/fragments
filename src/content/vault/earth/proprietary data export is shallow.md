## Mentions
- "every passport may be seen as a physical interface or an extension of a larger digital database accessible only to immigration officers and state authorities. In this database, the passport expands into a deeper history of departures and arrivals."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0yb8g6djdzb8cv1x5bqa6kq)
- "inaccessible archival depth that remains beyond individual control."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0yb8zmjnnzgx09445k4p419)
- "They could now more efficiently extract content from the users’ data sets, which also started offering its users the chance to copy the profile by downloading a zipped file that would seemingly include all the archived information in one’s Facebook profile. As Austrian law student Max Schrems has proved, however, this zipped file is only a fraction of what Facebook really archives. After submitting a request under the European “right to access” law, he made Facebook disclose all the information that the corporation had collected on him. Facebook sent him a CD with a 1,200-page PDF document containing far more substantial data than the generic archive offered for download (which, according to Schrem, amounts to only about 29 percent of the aggregated data)."
