title: dogfood provotypes
---

In the spirit of [[dogfooding]] I personally have built an endless number of half-finished systems that I abandoned before using due to changing requirements, environments and technical contexts. I've learnt and lost and relearnt a lot of specific technical knowledge in these processes, and wasted a lot of time. I still love to half-build things; I respect the process, and am considering how to document partial practise. I'm currently enjoying the notion of 'provotypes' [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^3cbdd3|(Smolicki, 2017)]], a term I identify in my practise of designing/building half-complete prototypes as a learning exercise. The artifact is either abandoned or remixed or iterated later on, but the process and insights have ongoing use and impact of 'provoking' insight.
