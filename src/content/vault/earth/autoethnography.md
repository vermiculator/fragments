- reflections on your own experience, later analysed and connected via theories from other literature - ethnographic view of your own experience

- trying to avoid the slip into [[biomythography]]?
- over-include in data collection without worry for relevancy or vulnerability, as you can sift and summarise in analysis stage
- asides, commentaries, and in-process memos, field notes, journal entries, historic artifacts, documents
- sensory data, thick description

## Mentions
- "As [Haynes](https://methods.sagepub.com/book/the-sage-handbook-of-qualitative-business-and-management-research-methods-v2/i374.xml) (2018) puts it, autoethnography is a method where “the researcher is the focus of reflexive inquiry”, but it is recognized that “the researcher’s self is inevitably experienced and positioned within a social \[and cultural] context”, and so autoethnography “enables the researcher themselves to form a subject of lived inquiry within a particular social \[and cultural] context”." - [David Gauntlett](https://davidgauntlett.com/research-practice/what-is-practice-based-research/)
- "Auto-ethnographers do not protect the readers from becoming emotionally involved in the case at hand (Muncey, 2005), but expose them to a “patchwork of feelings, experiences, emotions, and behaviors that portray a more complete view of life” (Wall 2008, p.10)."

- "ability “to connect the personal to the cultural”(Ellis and Bochner, 2000, p.739)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4q8vhgh58dgn3kjyjkxq32v) 
- "reflection written from the perspective of an isolated entity, but rather from the perspective of a conscious subject who recognizes its complex links to and an entanglement in wider social and cultural contexts of which the auto-ethnographer’s reader is also a participant. Moreover, in autoethnography the researcher’s personal experiences can or even should be explored parallel to the experiences of the other subjects (Ellis and Bochner, 2000; Maso, 2001). In this sense, the method acquires a dialogical dimension, and therefore does not risk being taken for a detached introspective monologue – a recurrent point of critique it receives (Coffey, 1999)."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4q8wtfspr44h9jqbej9ybtt)
- evaluation through "how much the narrative expresses the reality" as questionable, difficult, contestable [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4q8xbvsrtqfgq5h4zgbkrsg)
- "I propose to attend to (and possibly approach the evaluation of) my auto-ethnographically informed study of the modes of personal archiving a process of shaping, constructing and accounting for one, particular view on techno-cultural reality from within."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4q8yfdspb2r0jpn1fpbx4w1)
- "plug the reader into the trajectory of my life with technologies, as well as a series of decisions and responses made in relation to the proliferation of capturing technologies. I do it, for example, through highlighting transitory moments from one technology or technique to another."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4q8z86f7pfwqbjr87raqh15)
- "It is easy to fall into traps set by one’s beliefs and opinions. This is why I find it extremely important not to reduce research to the auto-ethnographic method alone. I find it necessary to complement auto-ethnography with other methods and other voices, to juxtapose"  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k4q90b82mj3r4gz6t25y94y8)
