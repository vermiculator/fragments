- note that not all hierarchies are inherently unjust, but many oppressive systems rely on arbitrary, non-consensual hierarchies in order to exercise control and domination
- reasonable hierarchies exist with consent and within context eg allowing a knowledgeable clinician to administer a complex treatment, vs the same clinician having complete power and control over every aspect of your life
