title: start with the right metaphor
parent:
  - "[[exploring ideas]]"
  - "[[design and engineering]]"

- in product design, experience design, service design etc
- prioritising the right functions and forms is easier with a clear coherent metaphor 
- makes decisions self evident
- who is this for and what metaphors will make sense for them
- keeps distributed teams on track with compatible mental models of what you're building 
- makes complex combinations of things simpler to conceptualise
- can be problematic if you're clinging too tight to a metaphor that no longer works for your goals or your resources
