"Deleuze and Guattari’s approach to identifying and harnessing opportunities for change can be used to amplify the [[Critical Data Studies|CDS]] agenda of challenging data power asymmetries and creating more widely valued data assemblages." - [[Four Data Discourses and Assemblage Forms A Methodological Framework|(Fussell, 2022)]]

possible sources for 

- assemblage theories: Deleuze and Guattari (1987), Bennett (2005), Latour (2005), DeLanda (2006, 2016), Nail (2017), and Buchanan (2021)
- “assemblage thinking” (Anderson et al., 2012; Hansen and Koch, 2022: 10; Müller and Schurr, 2016; Tseng, 2023)

Methods
- Component analysis: Break down the assemblage into its constituent parts and examine each component's properties and behaviors.
- Network analysis: Study the relationships between components, including the patterns of connection and interaction.
- grouping?
- content analysis - a methodologically explicit way of analyzing texts or images involving quantitative and qualitative procedures (Bell, 2011; Krippendorff, 2004; Mitchell, 2011; Schreier, 2014; Trilling and Jonkman, 2018)
