## Disambiguation 
- referring to a state of optimum arousal for a neurodivergent brain, one that allows for productive or creative activity with full absorption, also called hyper focus. Juxtaposes states of extreme executive dysfunction. Can feel subjectively very positive and be a desirable goal, but also have wider practical impact, especially in combination with alexithyma and the demands of [[anti~capitalism|capitalist modes of working]]
- OR
- in game design, referring (similarly but distinctly) to a state of optimum balance between engagement and disengagement, boredom and frustration. Crucially, this is balance formed from dissatisfaction, never quite flipping over enough into one negative that you drop out of the game. Keeping you on the edge of distress
- "a mental state achieved when performing a task wherein the level of challenge is commensurate with the player’s skill. Gameplay must walk the line between boredom and frustration to fall within the flow channel."
