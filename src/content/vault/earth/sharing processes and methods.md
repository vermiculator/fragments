### Notes
- frameworks for thinking and reasoning
- tech standardisation, instruction manuals
- guides, tutorials, walk-throughs, support
- microcosms of expertise
- lost arts and crafts
- heritage preservation for ephemeral things
- reverse engineering and lost blueprints
- remastering, preservation, and similar
- replicated procedure, scientific methods
- alterations and divergences on process
- feedback loops
- Generative AI becoming a curator of human methods and processes (eg searching how to x and assembling forum responses) and how that should at least be more explicit and sourced
