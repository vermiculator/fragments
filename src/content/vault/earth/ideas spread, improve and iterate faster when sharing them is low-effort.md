## The Concept
Ideas spread, improve and iterate faster when sharing them is low-effort. To encourage discussion the barrier to entry should be low.

## Notes
 - how 'social media' platforms all start with some specific concept of what they're intended for, but only gain traction if they're sufficiently expressive, and therefore sufficiently general-purpose
 - expression across a variety of mediums, for accessibility and preferred methods of communication
 - then produces a wider diversity of creators, content and audiences, which produces more valuable discussion, innovation, etc
 - both this opportunity for varied expression, and cultural homogeny in existing user bases of existing platforms, creates migration to new/alternative platforms
 - so new cultural ideas increasingly come from the semi-established platforms, before the corporate world has taken hold of them, eg the youth on tumblr then youth on tiktok
 - and these platforms both encourage a range of expressive forms
 - this is another reason for the rise of short-form content
- obviously there are other benefits to long form, but for having continuing discussions that  a wide range of people can take part in, short form and varied form allows the easiest route in to a discussion for the largest number of people
- some next steps for valuable online discussions could be encouraging empathetic and thoughtful conversation eg in frameworks such as nonviolent communication, as well as providing some level of contextual consistency and cohesion to allow for thought processes and idea development to flow in a path that can be retraced/followed for review, study, transparency, etc
