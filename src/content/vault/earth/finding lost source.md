- for personal use people don't always save source metadata, depending on context this metadata isn't always necessary for instrumental usage, or visual inspirations aren't always tracked directly
- different platforms, site cultures, offline cultures etc encourage and discourage and lay varying priority on keeping track of [[knowledge lineage]], authorship, contribution, etc
- contribution in open source cultures
- [[tumblr]] and others finding/adding source later in reblogs
- [[Pinterest]] and bookmarking with direct source, but [[link rot]]
- metadata inaccuracies and varying importance, priority on fixing them
- misattributed quotes, inaccurate folk attributions, etc
