## Mentions
-  "Marx also felt that Dov was too physically intimate with Sadie. When Dov had been at Sadie’s workstation, his hand kept drifting over to touch her and invade her space. The hand rested on her shoulder, the hand drifted onto her thigh, the hand on her keyboard, the hand on her mouse." (from [[Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow]]) Interesting in how hands on her tools are seen as similarly intimate to hands on her body - or is this meant to read hand on her hand on her mouse, either way
