- from my own experience in information practises i need a property/connection/link to have semantics associated
- what is a link in each context
- connections have meaning, labels and cadence and metadata
- this is my problem with [[actor network theory]] as I roughly begin to understand it - a [[flat ontology]] is just not a fair abstraction of reality as we aren't unhierarchically linked to everything in the same way, there are always power differentials and meaningful bonds that need acknowledging

---

whilst hyperlinks can retain extra info in specific arguments or with labels, its not very human-readable nor can account for the full extent of context needed in all cases eg asserting statements with authorship and assuredness differentials

semantic web triples (or even better, quads) can account for this. see [[RDF quads for claim provenance|RDF quads for statement assertion]]
