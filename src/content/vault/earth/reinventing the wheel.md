- tendency to 'reinvent the wheel', particularly by young enthusiastic well-meaning people
- all the limiting factors to 'student projects' that are artificially constrained to grade rather than aimed toward real-world use, lack of real experience and resources
- people are forced to reinvent at all levels of experience due to lack of access to prior methods and works
- lack of coordination, collaboration and combining resources due to (sometimes intellectual but mostly financially) motivated competition and [proprietary, confidential works](logseq/bak/pages/proprietary-problems.md).
- but also don't use the wheel just to uphold the norm, maintain [reasonable skepticism](reasonable%20skepticism.md)
