## Mentions
- "pervasively operating mechanisms of capture and archiving and that the boundary between voluntary and involuntary forms of those has become ever more questionable today."  [⤴️](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jye2eqpmr9bxekrb4jxyt764)
- "Developed in 1994 by Netscape programmers, cookies introduced what I would call a mnemotechnological layer to online surfing which, until then, had been characterized by a lack of pervasive capture and traceability as we know it today (Shah and Kesan, 2004). [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^4b2745|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
- "Cookies fundamentally altered the nature of surfing the Web from being a relatively anonymous activity, like wandering the streets of a large city, to the kind of environment where records of one’s transactions, movements and even desires could be stored, sorted, mined and sold. (Schwartz, 2001, no pagination)."  [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^4b2745|(Smolicki, 2017)]]

	- "there are activist organizations that address involuntary exposure to capture and archiving by attempting to develop various kinds of technical solutions. A tool such as Tor – volunteer-operated servers"  [[library/Para-Archives - Rethinking Personal Archiving Practices in the Times of Capture Culture#^adf16e|(Smolicki, 2017)]]
