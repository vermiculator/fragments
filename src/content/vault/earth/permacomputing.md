"A holistic approach to computing and sustainability inspired from permaculture" [[#^2d8c9e|->]]

"Permacomputing encourages the maximization of hardware lifespan, minimization of energy usage and focuses on the use of already available computational resources. It values maintenance and refactoring of systems to keep them efficient, instead of [planned obsolescence](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/commodity.html), permacomputing practices [planned longevity](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/salvage_computing.html). It is about using computation only when it has a strengthening effect on ecosystems." [[#^2d8c9e|->]]
