OS near-duopoly of Max and Windows, limited cross-compatibility in the mainstream, Linux and open source  communities underfunded, understaffed, uncoordinated, etc. Low literacy in the building blocks of tech and lack of support for DIY tech as well as active prevention of DIY tech by industry practices of black-boxing, little active support for modularity and repair. Windows and Mac familiarity and holdover are hard to break but they also hold favour due to attention to interface and focus on home users. Most useful/commonly used/familiar software not being packaged for Linux is biggest prevention of uptake imo. Microsoft Office being tied up into Windows OS in particular. 
- The problem of this made very clear by the global outage of Windows machines caused by Crowdstrike pushing a faulty update in July 2024
- previous instances of cyber-attacks targeting popular legacy Windows OSs (caused trouble in particular for the NHS)
