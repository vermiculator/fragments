- no group of people are exactly alike even though they share characteristics 
- no experience of culture is identical, no experience of disability is identical, no human is identical
- 'if you've met one autistic person, you've met one autistic person'
- we are all individuals with varying appearances, beliefs, motivations, lifestyles, etc 
- we may just generalise and categorise in order to connect with those we feel can relate to us best
- people will use the identity markers and labels that they feel best fit their complex human experience and they are the authority on that
    - exceptional cases being overidentification with an aspect of humanity that genuinely has nothing to do with your experience such as so-called 'transracialism' but these cases are complex and rare
- language has meaning and it's important to consider other interpretations but usage changes over time and [[definitions are descriptive, not prescriptive]]
