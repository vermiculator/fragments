## Notes
- TODO
- consent to film, consent to post, consent to quote even
- I saw someone grant consent for body doubling over tiktok live - new levels to which I didn't consider that consent could be required
- young people, your own children, new era of child star
- boundaries with your loved ones and what they post of you
- 'vulnerable' people, framing, misrepresentation
- inspiration porn
- strangers
