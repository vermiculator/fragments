* let things be simple, let things be complex. Complexity as a threat - diversity and variety as a threat - causes colonialism, fascism, authoritarianism
* But also, over bureaucracy, lots of problems caused by set pathways
* Category error: dysphoria as a sum of its parts - does this relate to autism as well - meeting the threshold
* On simplification limiting diversity and variety, self stunting, patient care etc philosophy tube - Institutions have a drive to eliminate outliers and funnel into set pathways - limiting variety goes against what the patients need (and generally humans)
* On complexity and being limited by it, willie muse on self and complexity and water and diet coke
* Simplification as a 'natural law' - where is this and isn't this applicable
