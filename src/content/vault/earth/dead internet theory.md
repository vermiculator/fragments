It's theorised(where?) that the majority of internet content is now algorithmically generated/bots interacting with bots.

literature only somewhat supports this (acc. to wikipedia)

but recently increasing use of  general-purpose consumer AI/everyday chatbots/AI integrations in everything/AI voiceovers - articles and videos are evidently mass-produced - this is clearly a growing problem

but not 'majority' yet. and still much historical content from before the AI boom, if it hasn't broken yet ([[link rot]] and [[obsolete data formats]] and [[obsolete platforms]])
