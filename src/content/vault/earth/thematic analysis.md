title: thematic analysis
---

- frequency of pattern isn't enough, but significance to participants and topic
- themes identified through inductive active-reading emerging from data, or from deductive theory-driven  looking for evidence for ideas
- don't just quote or paraphrase to fit - build an argument or story about the data with quotes as evidence - go beyond what is said to explore meaning/implication/pattern - what the data reveals not what it says
- be a part of the unfolding
- what is being said and HOW is it being said. commentary to connect and explain your quotes - contradictions and shared logics
- coherent narrative on how the themes matter
