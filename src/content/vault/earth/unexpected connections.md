common motivation for better connecting between silos of information, cultures, etc, is the potential benefit to both parties when a new link is forged and strengthened. antithesis of this is when similar but distinct or opposed ideas/groups/etc are conflated. I find [[explicit disambiguation]] a useful concept for this but it can still draw things that don't want to be aligned or associated together. [[polysemy]] doesn't inherently mean closeness, relatedness or direct opposition but brings similar signs/words/etc together under one category eg by language root and provides a bridge for ideation.

in terms of information access, connectivity often provides unexpected connections as motivating factor - but [[cluttered tags]], [[acronym discourse]], [[wrong forum]] misunderstandings and algorithmic recommendation oversteps/data privacy issues can provide some insight on possible problems of hyperconnectivity.
