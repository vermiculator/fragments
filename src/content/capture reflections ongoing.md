title: capture reflections ongoing
---

autoethnography, diarise everything I want to capture and maybe why, write it all down and see if its adequate..... Basically aiming for there to be nothing left that I wanted to capture and couldn't. Even note when I thought about capturing and decided my memory was the best place to keep it. And note the other places/ways I capture (screenshots on PC, screenshots on phone, photos on phone, videos on phone, sometimes audio on phone)

| what?                                     | multiple times? | why?                                                              | format?                                                      | adequate?                                                                                                                                      | note                                                                                           |

| feeling of sunshine and warm wind on face | yes             | pleasant and weather is unreliably nice when you want it          | very extensive tech and still wouldn't simulate full context | yeah, maybe we shouldn't capture this, atmosphere is basically unique per situation                                                            | what shouldn't be replicated artifically/non-directly? simulating bodily experience gets weird |
| insight, redacted                         | yes             | don't want to make same mistake again                             | narrative, dialogue                                          | no, could be useful as a 'if this then that' or tip, don't want to read full story if I've experienced it already, just need a cue to remember | could just capture a cue, full context needed only for sharing                                 |
| format or structure of a day              | yes             | understanding patterns of experience and workflow without details | calendar data or written narrative                           | no, too high fidelity, requires multiple cases and requires a mass of extraneous data                                                          | levels of fidelity, different for different captures                                           |
